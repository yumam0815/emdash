# EmDash delegated release Action

This experimental Action submits a package release record to an EmDash delegated release service. It requests a GitHub OpenID Connect (OIDC) token for each service call, so the workflow does not store a release-service secret.

## Workflow setup

Grant the job permission to request an OIDC token, then pass the publisher DID and generated release record to the Action:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/release.yml"
name: Release plugin

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7

      - name: Build release record
        run: pnpm build:release-record --output release.json

      - name: Publish through EmDash
        id: release
        uses: emdash-cms/emdash/apps/release-action@<exact-commit>
        with:
          service-url: https://release.example.com
          publisher-did: did:web:publisher.example.com
          release-file: release.json
```

Replace the example service URL, publisher DID, build command, and exact commit with values for your publisher. Pin the Action to an exact commit while the delegated release protocol remains experimental.

The release record must conform to `com.emdashcms.experimental.package.release`. The service validates its package, version, artifact, declared access, and provenance before publication.

## Inputs

| Input                   | Required | Default                    | Purpose                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `service-url`           | Yes      | —                          | HTTPS origin of the delegated release service.                                                 |
| `publisher-did`         | Yes      | —                          | DID that owns the package profile and release records.                                         |
| `release-file`          | Yes      | —                          | JSON file containing the package release record. The path must stay inside `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`. |
| `idempotency-key`       | No       | Current run ID and attempt | Stable key used to replay the same submission.                                                 |
| `poll-interval-seconds` | No       | `5`                        | Delay between intent status requests.                                                          |
| `timeout-minutes`       | No       | `30`                       | Maximum polling time.                                                                          |
| `wait-for-approval`     | No       | `false`                    | Continue polling when the intent reaches `awaiting_approval`.                                  |

The default idempotency key is stable for one GitHub run attempt. Set `idempotency-key` when separate jobs must replay the same submission identity.

## Outputs

| Output         | Value                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `intent-id`    | Release intent ULID.                               |
| `state`        | Published, terminal, or `awaiting_approval` state. |
| `approval-url` | Approval URL when passkey approval is required.    |
| `release-uri`  | Published AT URI.                                  |
| `release-cid`  | Published record CID.                              |
| `reason-code`  | Stable failure reason for a terminal intent.       |

With the default `wait-for-approval: false`, an intent awaiting approval returns successfully with `state` and `approval-url` outputs. Terminal states other than `published` fail the step. Network failures, service pauses, and polling timeouts also fail with a stable client error code.
