# @emdash-cms/registry-lexicons

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2644](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2644) [`6178888`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/61788888bf5933e2a9ac310a931f1c241fa63878) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds shared, CID-bound plugin-listing moderation contracts for reducing signed AT Protocol labels and deciding which package-profile and release revisions are eligible for display.

  The registry Lexicons add experimental public assessment and policy queries. The contracts cover publisher-controlled listing metadata and displayed media; they do not assess plugin code.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2067](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2067) [`07c9f21`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/07c9f210db300803f49ecf2b8a18fe173e459a28) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds the `packageProfileExtension` lexicon and its generated types, plus a `provenance` reference field on the package release extension.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1719](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1719) [`7c5de08`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7c5de08f6370ea88500b7ec425d58b2c82443260) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a `taxonomies:read` plugin capability with read-only taxonomy access: plugins that declare it get `ctx.taxonomies` to list taxonomy definitions (`getAll()`), fetch the terms of a taxonomy (`getTerms()`), and read the terms assigned to a content entry (`getEntryTerms()`) — in-process and in both sandbox runners.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1447](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1447) [`141aa11`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/141aa11213206d9ea5e14d1f1cd75c07cfacae7b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes `@atcute` peer dependency warnings on install ([#1435](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1435))

  Installing EmDash pulled in mismatched `@atcute` package versions, so `pnpm install` / `npm install` reported unmet peer warnings for `@atcute/identity` and `@atcute/lexicons`. The bundled `@atcute` dependencies are now aligned on v2 and installs are clean. If your project also depends on `@atcute` packages directly, note they have moved to v2 (`@atcute/client` 5, `@atcute/lexicons` 2, `@atcute/atproto` 4, `@atcute/oauth-node-client` 2).

- [#1461](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1461) [`b01aa9b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b01aa9bbb436bcec07516b499eb0516cfbe414b4) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes registry installs failing with "Plugin manifest has changed since you consented" for plugins that declare hook-registration capabilities (email transport, email events, page fragments) or read user records. Plugin bundles now declare their access as a structured `declaredAccess` contract that the registry record, the install-consent dialog, and the sandbox all read consistently, so every capability a plugin declares is shown for consent and enforced — no capability is silently dropped. Re-publish affected plugins to adopt the new bundle format; existing installs are unaffected.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#929](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/929) [`5464b55`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5464b551f0100d33fe9adbdd74d3444d37321209) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `RECORD_NSIDS` and `QUERY_NSIDS` const arrays alongside the existing `NSID` map. They enumerate the record-shaped and query-shaped lexicons in this package so consumers (e.g. tooling that builds OAuth `repo:` / `rpc:` scopes) can derive their list from the lexicon set instead of hand-rolling one that drifts.

### Patch Changes

- [#923](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/923) [`943df46`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/943df46d62043df386eef4664fbba4710be16c31) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `@emdash-cms/registry-lexicons`: generated TypeScript types and runtime validation schemas for the EmDash plugin registry lexicons (`com.emdashcms.experimental.*`). EXPERIMENTAL — NSIDs and shapes will change while RFC 0001 is in flight; pin to an exact version.
