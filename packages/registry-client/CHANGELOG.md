# @emdash-cms/registry-client

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2647](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2647) [`e3ad082`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e3ad0823121704c508cd104783a59fccd3f6a44e) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds signed-label policy and listing-status support to the plugin registry client. Registry requests use the aggregator's required listing policy with an optional accepted-labeler declaration, and withdrawn releases are excluded from install and update results.

  The EmDash admin waits for a fresh listing-policy response before rendering registry metadata, uses the approved author name or publisher DID instead of a mutable handle, and does not request media for an unapproved release. Install, update, and media-proxy checks enforce listing withdrawal independently from the existing plugin-code and capability checks.

  Registry artifact downloads and proxied media connect only to the public IP addresses validated for each URL, preventing DNS changes between validation and connection from reaching private services.

### Patch Changes

- [#1447](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1447) [`141aa11`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/141aa11213206d9ea5e14d1f1cd75c07cfacae7b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes `@atcute` peer dependency warnings on install ([#1435](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1435))

  Installing EmDash pulled in mismatched `@atcute` package versions, so `pnpm install` / `npm install` reported unmet peer warnings for `@atcute/identity` and `@atcute/lexicons`. The bundled `@atcute` dependencies are now aligned on v2 and installs are clean. If your project also depends on `@atcute` packages directly, note they have moved to v2 (`@atcute/client` 5, `@atcute/lexicons` 2, `@atcute/atproto` 4, `@atcute/oauth-node-client` 2).

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1319](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1319) [`69bdc97`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/69bdc97e3e4b69a111b3e5210900e23f35134f8d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix `require is not defined` crash on every EmDash API route under `astro dev` on Cloudflare Workers ([#1292](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1292)).

  `@emdash-cms/registry-client` listed `semver` (CommonJS) in `dependencies`, which the build externalizes -- so consumers loaded a nested CJS copy. Vite's SSR module runner (workerd) evaluates modules with no `require` binding, so semver's internal `require()` threw and took down any route whose import graph reached registry-client (schema, plugins, env compatibility checks). semver is now bundled into the ESM output, so nothing CommonJS reaches the worker.

### Minor Changes

- [#1238](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1238) [`60c0b2e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/60c0b2eeab7726471b313d0c453de82df1e08558) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Registry plugins can now declare environment requirements. A plugin's manifest may set a release-level `requires` block (e.g. `{ "env:emdash": ">=1.0.0", "env:astro": ">=4.16" }`), which is published into the release record. When browsing a registry plugin, the admin compares those constraints against the running EmDash and Astro versions: if the host doesn't satisfy them, it shows a compatibility warning and disables the Install button. The server enforces the same check on install and update, refusing an incompatible release with `ENV_INCOMPATIBLE` so the gate can't be bypassed.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1126](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1126) [`cf3c706`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cf3c706a65087696eb6cca5844b7668a50e4a090) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `emdash-plugin update-package`, a CLI command for editing an already-published plugin's registry record (license, authors, security contacts, name, description, keywords) without cutting a new release. Without `--yes` it prints a diff and exits without writing; with `--yes` it writes the updated record to the publisher's PDS using atproto's `swapRecord` precondition (concurrent writes surface as `STALE_RECORD` instead of silently overwriting each other) and bumps `lastUpdated`. Optional fields use a "manifest absent = no change" policy: removing a key from the manifest doesn't wipe the published value, matching `publish` semantics. Renaming a plugin via the manifest now surfaces a "looks like a rename" message listing the publisher's existing packages instead of a generic not-found, so publishers don't accidentally orphan releases under the old slug.

  The publishing client (`@emdash-cms/registry-client`) gains a `swapRecord` parameter on `putRecord` and `unsafePutRecord` for callers needing optimistic-concurrency writes.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1112](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1112) [`3756168`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/37561682224447c7280648dc770ab408afc4186a) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Validates aggregator responses at the read-side trust boundary in `DiscoveryClient`. Two layers run:
  - **Response envelope** (`uri`, `cid`, `did`, `slug`, `version`, …): `DiscoveryClient` now routes every call through `@atcute/client`'s schema-validating `.call()` against the aggregator method's output lexicon. Request params are validated too. A non-conforming envelope throws `ClientValidationError`.
  - **Embedded signed `profile` / `release` records** (typed `unknown` by the aggregator lexicon because they are relayed verbatim from publisher repos under a different lexicon namespace): now `safeParse`'d against `com.emdashcms.experimental.package.profile` / `release`. A conforming record is returned as the typed lexicon shape; a non-conforming one is surfaced as `null` so one bad record doesn't fail an entire search page.

  Refines the return types from `unknown` to `PackageProfile.Main | null` / `PackageRelease.Main | null` (new exported `ValidatedPackageView` / `ValidatedReleaseView` / `ValidatedSearchPackages` / `ValidatedListReleases` types). Callers must null-check. The registry install handler now fails closed when the aggregator returns a release record that does not conform to its lexicon.

  Validation is structural only — the lexicon's `uri` format permits non-HTTP schemes, so UI rendering these URLs still applies its own scheme allow-list.

- [#923](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/923) [`943df46`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/943df46d62043df386eef4664fbba4710be16c31) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `@emdash-cms/registry-client`: atproto-aware client for the EmDash plugin registry. Three independent layers — credential storage (filesystem / env-vars / in-memory), publisher repo operations, and discovery against an aggregator. EXPERIMENTAL — pin to an exact version while RFC 0001 is in flight.
