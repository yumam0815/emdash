# emdash

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2582](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2582) [`8d8d3de`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8d8d3de006ca8652f0ec9e531dd8be7d851e1a4f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds numbered page navigation and page-size controls to the local Media Library. Media list requests can opt into numbered pages with `page` and receive an exact `totalCount`; cursor pagination remains the default.

  `MediaLibrary` accepts controlled numbered pagination through `pagination`. Existing `hasMore` and `onLoadMore` props remain supported when `pagination` is omitted.

- [#2584](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2584) [`a1ddcfb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a1ddcfb24438ab9af077f795a9dbbe1ba91e1b52) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds flat media folders to the `emdash` REST and typed client APIs. Existing media remains in the
  Main library after upgrade, so sites do not need to migrate media assignments.

  - Includes database migration `072_media_folders`.

  Use `GET` or `POST /_emdash/api/media/folders` to list or create folders, and `PUT` or
  `DELETE /_emdash/api/media/folders/:id` to rename or delete them. Folder reads require
  `media:read`; folder writes require `media:edit_any`. Typed clients expose the corresponding
  `mediaFolderList`, `mediaFolderCreate`, `mediaFolderUpdate`, and `mediaFolderDelete` methods.

  Media list requests can filter by a folder ID or use `folderId=unfiled` for the Main library.
  Media updates and `mediaSetFolder` accept a folder ID, `null`, or `unfiled`. Authors can assign
  their own media, while editors can assign any media.

  Deleting a folder returns its media to the Main library without changing media IDs, storage keys,
  URLs, or usage records.

- [#2480](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2480) [`b4c73ac`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b4c73acd9ba718f55182279dd9c8dd2b6ef2df22) Thanks [@DavidPivert](https://github.com/DavidPivert)! - `LiveSearch` now scopes its results to the locale of the page it is used on.

  **Behaviour change.** The component reads `Astro.currentLocale` and forwards it as the `locale` query parameter to `/_emdash/api/search` and `/_emdash/api/search/suggest`, which both already filtered on it. Until now the component never sent one, so a translated site got every entry back once per language — a French visitor searching from a French page saw each result twice, the second one opening its English page. Sites with `i18n` configured that relied on searching across every locale will see fewer results than before.

  Two ways to opt out: pass an explicit `locale` to search a different one, or `locale={null}` to search across every locale, which is the previous behaviour.

  ```astro
  <!-- results in the page's own locale (new default) -->
  <LiveSearch collections={["posts", "pages"]} />

  <!-- every locale, as before -->
  <LiveSearch collections={["posts", "pages"]} locale={null} />
  ```

  Sites without Astro's `i18n` configured are unaffected: `Astro.currentLocale` is `undefined` there, so no `locale` parameter is sent and the search still spans everything.

- [#2624](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2624) [`436f63d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/436f63d7f9f8bf43062ccdbbed76b98307b59149) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds focal points for local images so cover-cropped thumbnails, galleries, and image components keep the selected subject visible.

- [#2586](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2586) [`815553c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/815553cbcb3f0263116a1dcde3a039fadd867000) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds flat-folder organization to the local Media Library. Editors can create, rename, and delete folders. Authors can organize their own local media, and editors can organize any local media, through Media Details or by dragging a media card or row onto a visible folder.

  Uploads continue to enter the Main library. Deleting a folder returns its media to the Main library without deleting files or changing their URLs.

- [#2538](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2538) [`9c52b39`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9c52b39fa82f3c13fe9bfbc04d0aa36de4acc219) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds a media usage tracking setting. Tracking is enabled during initial setup. Existing sites enable it from Settings, keep the page open while EmDash scans existing content, and can return later to continue from saved progress.

- [#2106](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2106) [`f00174b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f00174b798aa94f31e51dc4b3402f186c25532c7) Thanks [@gruntlord5](https://github.com/gruntlord5)! - Updates `sqlite()` and the EmDash CLI to use Node.js's built-in SQLite driver. Node.js deployments can install and run EmDash without compiling or downloading the `better-sqlite3` native add-on. Existing SQLite database files and `sqlite({ url })` configuration continue to work.

  This release requires Node.js 22.16 or later. Check the installed version with `node --version` and upgrade Node.js before updating EmDash if it reports an earlier release.

  Node.js 22 prints its standard `ExperimentalWarning: SQLite is an experimental feature` message when the SQLite adapter loads. Node.js 24 does not print this warning.

  If `better-sqlite3` is listed in the site's `package.json` only for EmDash, remove that dependency after updating.

- [#2538](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2538) [`9c52b39`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9c52b39fa82f3c13fe9bfbc04d0aa36de4acc219) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Removes scheduled media usage recovery. Media usage tracking now advances only while an administrator keeps its settings page visible. This breaks Cloudflare deployments that configure `mediaUsageCron` and Node.js integrations that provide a custom `CronScheduler`.

  #### What should I do?

  On Cloudflare, remove the dedicated media usage Cron Trigger and the `mediaUsageCron` option. Keep the general Cron Trigger unchanged; no replacement trigger is required.

  If you provide a custom Node.js scheduler, remove `setMediaUsageMaintenance()`. A custom `CronScheduler` now implements only `start()`, `stop()`, `reschedule()`, and `setSystemCleanup()`.

  Keep **Settings → Media usage tracking** open until it shows **Ready**. If the page closes, return to continue from saved progress.

- [#2647](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2647) [`e3ad082`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e3ad0823121704c508cd104783a59fccd3f6a44e) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds signed-label policy and listing-status support to the plugin registry client. Registry requests use the aggregator's required listing policy with an optional accepted-labeler declaration, and withdrawn releases are excluded from install and update results.

  The EmDash admin waits for a fresh listing-policy response before rendering registry metadata, uses the approved author name or publisher DID instead of a mutable handle, and does not request media for an unapproved release. Install, update, and media-proxy checks enforce listing withdrawal independently from the existing plugin-code and capability checks.

  Registry artifact downloads and proxied media connect only to the public IP addresses validated for each URL, preventing DNS changes between validation and connection from reaching private services.

### Patch Changes

- [#2683](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2683) [`3e90689`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3e90689102d02e479c0130dcee520c5209530e94) Thanks [@hossein-webdev](https://github.com/hossein-webdev)! - Fixes AVIF images being rejected with "File type not allowed" on upload. `image/avif` is back in the default media allowlist alongside PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP, so editors can upload `.avif` files again from the media library and from image fields that use the default allowlist.

  The admin file picker now offers `.avif` files and renders their thumbnails, the built-in "Images" preset in a field's allowed-types editor includes AVIF, and `.avif` works as extension shorthand in a field's `allowedMimeTypes`.

  SVG stays excluded from the default allowlist.

- [#2599](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2599) [`b383a67`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b383a67b5f4a75d5757f76c4385e9ee83df6f3de) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes code blocks in the admin and inline visual editors so Tab and Shift+Tab indent and outdent code instead of moving focus.

- [#2445](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2445) [`f6da16b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f6da16b8cea400d1d6dbcb6b9540d0c59004c58f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds a one-time, administrator-controlled process for enabling automatic media usage indexing in production.

- [#2538](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2538) [`9c52b39`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9c52b39fa82f3c13fe9bfbc04d0aa36de4acc219) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Speeds up the initial scan when administrators turn on media usage tracking on Cloudflare Workers and Node.js.

- [#2598](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2598) [`0f225eb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0f225ebe77559139570cef6231360b60f99be9b5) Thanks [@Glacier-Luo](https://github.com/Glacier-Luo)! - Fixes session-authenticated CMS comment submissions so they retain the user identity and honor automatic approval settings.

- [#2600](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2600) [`2fde0f9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2fde0f9e5b5d864bcd8006ec243ff2c5f7dde9df) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes the Playground welcome dialog reappearing after it has been dismissed and the page is reloaded or Edit mode is toggled.

- [#2556](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2556) [`37c5010`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/37c50108aa3489c134f182919cbf78bfa256e520) Thanks [@cherenkov](https://github.com/cherenkov)! - Fixes `emdash content create` and `content update` failing with "Cannot construct a Request with a Request object that has already been used" when the stored access token has expired. Requests carrying a body are now retried correctly after the token is refreshed.

- [#2470](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2470) [`f527127`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f5271270ea32f8c771016d2b4cdf02cb1a0505e2) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds a coverage-aware Used in section to local media details.

- [#2612](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2612) [`628630a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/628630acb5bc0b010d7bd317db9d02b70a70d579) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Fixes SQLite and D1 sites where an interrupted upgrade left the byline credits table staged as `_emdash_content_bylines_new`, so pages, feeds and the admin reported no entries although the content was intact. The next migration run restores the table and the stored credits.

- [#2472](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2472) [`abd1042`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/abd1042ae92ba9c8e9416fed4dc910ecce4802b3) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes seeded media references using a different ID from their media-library item and prepares Used in data for newly seeded development sites.

- [#2106](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2106) [`f00174b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f00174b798aa94f31e51dc4b3402f186c25532c7) Thanks [@gruntlord5](https://github.com/gruntlord5)! - Fixes boolean query parameters on SQLite, including boolean equality filters in the plugin storage API.

- [#2463](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2463) [`f613a14`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f613a1470581ad750183ba74ba9562d624db8d88) Thanks [@helio-cf](https://github.com/helio-cf)! - Fixes media previews for streaming providers such as Cloudflare Stream. Video from these providers now shows its poster thumbnail in the media library grid and list, plays in the detail panel instead of stalling at 0:00, and reports the file size the provider supplies. Also exports `Media` from `emdash/ui`, so frontends can render provider-backed video and audio that `Image` cannot.

- Updated dependencies [[`724241f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/724241f95f390a09f896a817f4e48aa2883ddbd7), [`72664ad`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/72664ad09c230e5b0ba5b55789b5eb118c6b487e), [`3e90689`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3e90689102d02e479c0130dcee520c5209530e94), [`2ffda17`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2ffda1737cfbe57c5d10bf57f2b3a48f4d49ae4a), [`42fa5d8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/42fa5d8ed3ee1858468603eb3d5a39810cf20e27), [`8d8d3de`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8d8d3de006ca8652f0ec9e531dd8be7d851e1a4f), [`2b54096`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2b540969f3a73f670c724c17ac59d778d429e055), [`76dd3eb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/76dd3ebee96ddf53a149d09f98919d43f07fd53a), [`b383a67`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b383a67b5f4a75d5757f76c4385e9ee83df6f3de), [`05b0a8b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/05b0a8bb2453d14dd2a65ea22a1e6af6d0a3048b), [`1f2678b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1f2678b7a477fdd225d2888f50fa664c85cf9e43), [`724241f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/724241f95f390a09f896a817f4e48aa2883ddbd7), [`436f63d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/436f63d7f9f8bf43062ccdbbed76b98307b59149), [`815553c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/815553cbcb3f0263116a1dcde3a039fadd867000), [`9c52b39`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9c52b39fa82f3c13fe9bfbc04d0aa36de4acc219), [`f527127`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f5271270ea32f8c771016d2b4cdf02cb1a0505e2), [`e3ad082`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e3ad0823121704c508cd104783a59fccd3f6a44e), [`52f7c91`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/52f7c91ae9efe2a9b023ea7b6cb739376f8da096), [`7571581`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7571581d598803162f59c6105e23fb0bf29f6520), [`72664ad`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/72664ad09c230e5b0ba5b55789b5eb118c6b487e), [`f613a14`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f613a1470581ad750183ba74ba9562d624db8d88), [`1c6b893`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1c6b893b40134aeaeedd056594d5bd7b6bfc1a53)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#2438](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2438) [`0aa1bc8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0aa1bc84a3a652b31ffb15cfd7c2d4b767b83e37) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `emdash migrate` for checking, reporting, and safely applying the exact core migration set recorded by a deployment build.

- [#2437](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2437) [`34336e1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/34336e1570fe2ddaf063b0a0363a9132cf823b8b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds deployment-managed core migrations so production databases can be updated before a new version of the site starts serving traffic.

  To adopt the workflow, build the site, inspect and apply its migrations with `emdash migrate`, deploy that same build, then run `emdash migrate --check` to verify the database. Existing sites continue applying migrations automatically by default; switch the runtime to `check` only after the deployment migration job is reliable.

  Follow [Manage Core Database Migrations](https://docs.emdashcms.com/deployment/core-migrations/) for setup, credentials, target confirmation, CI configuration, and rollout guidance.

- [#2437](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2437) [`34336e1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/34336e1570fe2ddaf063b0a0363a9132cf823b8b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds public migration identity and exact-status APIs so deployment tooling can verify and run the same core migration set as the installed EmDash version.

- [#2437](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2437) [`34336e1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/34336e1570fe2ddaf063b0a0363a9132cf823b8b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds deployment migration executors for the built-in SQLite, libSQL, and PostgreSQL database adapters with secret-free build metadata.

- [#2437](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2437) [`34336e1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/34336e1570fe2ddaf063b0a0363a9132cf823b8b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `auto`, `check`, and `manual` runtime migration modes so deployments can verify or manage core database migrations before application traffic while existing sites remain on automatic migrations by default.

### Patch Changes

- [#2552](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2552) [`2c30503`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2c305031595934066065e2e20f1c58a76d84d1d8) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes intermittent logged-out bounces immediately after login, signup, or invite acceptance on D1 and Durable Object databases with read replication enabled. The request that establishes the session now persists its read-replica bookmark, so the next request sees the newly created user instead of querying a replica that hasn't caught up yet.

### Minor Changes

- [#2354](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2354) [`a9ace36`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a9ace36a0dc697d996b6b0507809d0d2fc39226b) Thanks [@masonjames](https://github.com/masonjames)! - Adds MCP tools for safely updating collections and fields without deleting and recreating their schemas.

- [#2187](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2187) [`6a77862`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6a7786217adee382c92af4cf5e26f3bae6aa0de8) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Add a trusted plugin extension point for contributing isolated, host-framed panels to the saved content editor settings sidebar. Panels support collection and role filtering, deterministic ordering, manifest lifecycle checks, and render-error recovery.

- [#1973](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1973) [`5224b57`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5224b5711ae36f6302e01abdcba586c615a03b16) Thanks [@CacheMeOwside](https://github.com/CacheMeOwside)! - Adds `titleField` and `dateField` optional collection options to choose which field is used as an entry's title and which date the content list shows and sorts by.

- [#2194](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2194) [`2d5fb0b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2d5fb0bccdff34de6935d5cd59bca967a8974dc4) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Adds collection-configured custom field columns to admin content lists. Collection seeds and schema APIs can declare up to four supported fields through `admin.listColumns`; EmDash validates them when building the manifest and renders their stored values between the title and status columns.

- [#2342](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2342) [`f8a4fce`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f8a4fcefd297da15658b919a4d91109605e8f7b3) Thanks [@fbartolitsch](https://github.com/fbartolitsch)! - Fixes localized taxonomy navigation and editor choices so each admin surface follows the active content locale. Public taxonomy helpers now report visible term counts for the active content locale instead of combining assignments across translations.

- [#2213](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2213) [`e5cda04`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e5cda046608ee83ffbfeda5bd2de0ec8021a3207) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Adds server-side filtering for indexed custom fields through the REST client and plugin content list APIs.

- [#2212](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2212) [`fefb702`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fefb702763f2cbd3921124ef3358e7cac3f9dd64) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Adds opt-in database indexes for scalar custom fields and stable cursor pagination when ordering content lists by those fields.

- [#2499](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2499) [`1c4d4f0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1c4d4f04b2eddae529e802fa08e392939701a977) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `middleware.outer` configuration for returning responses before EmDash initializes and finalizing fully mutated responses after rendering.

- [#1947](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1947) [`8313255`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8313255a60f0e6e85d3dc19143cdd479f1e4c8be) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds the authenticated caller to plugin route handlers. Private plugin API routes now receive the requesting user as `ctx.user` (native format) / `routeCtx.user` (standard format) — `{ id, email, name, role, createdAt }` — so plugins can implement per-user logic without trusting a user id from the request body. Public routes and machine tokens with no bound user receive `undefined`.

- [#2469](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2469) [`ef32567`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ef32567fd5e7d9011f5ec9fb630e597cb5846312) Thanks [@helio-cf](https://github.com/helio-cf)! - Generates precise TypeScript types for repeater fields. Type generation emitted `unknown` for every repeater, so consuming code had to declare row shapes by hand and cast to them. It now emits an inline row type built from the field's sub-fields, with enumerated options for a `select` sub-field and the media object shape for an `image` sub-field. A sub-field that is not required is typed as nullable, matching what content validation accepts, and a repeater with no sub-fields still emits `unknown`.

  Regenerate types after upgrading. Code that casts a repeater to a hand-written row type may now report errors where that type has drifted from the schema.

- [#2431](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2431) [`88f29f3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/88f29f3bf7566c487c283663973ea1de8308f6a9) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Adds `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` on `/_emdash/api/taxonomies/{name}` plus `GET /_emdash/api/taxonomies/{name}/translations`, so a taxonomy definition can be read, edited, and removed rather than only listed and created. `GET` and `PUT` address one locale's definition via `?locale=`; `DELETE` takes no locale and removes the taxonomy outright — every locale's definition, every term under that name, and those terms' content assignments.

- [#2195](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2195) [`4c565ea`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4c565ea7f99d62f423aa0f61e183f3da37dd8925) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Allow trusted React plugins to add manifest-aware, role-filtered content-list columns without taking ownership of the host table, pagination, or row actions.

- [#2505](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2505) [`5828233`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/582823328ea2d205c72e25d3456029a4c49e649d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds native Unicode slugs and requires published entries in routable collections to have a slug. Collections used only for internal or referenced content can set `routable: false` before publishing slugless entries.

### Patch Changes

- [#2305](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2305) [`f59f36d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f59f36d5e33e3554af0ddb5e4add3fcc12eb2504) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes 404 logging for content misses. Templates answer a missing entry with a redirect to /404, which previously left the real missed path unrecorded — the log only ever accumulated one aggregate "/404" row. Misses are now logged under the path the visitor actually requested, and hits on the /404 error page itself are no longer logged.

- [#2374](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2374) [`70f9ddc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/70f9ddcea75063787794dae092a400f093c58807) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Fixes returning visitors getting a page without CSS or JavaScript after a deploy that changed only code. Cached routes now revalidate against the build as well as the content, so a browser holding HTML from an earlier deployment is served a fresh page instead of a 304 pointing at asset files that deployment no longer has.

- [#2443](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2443) [`3ceabc4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3ceabc47467b5fab0c0a83f7beea54b3b6e3e34f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds automatic, resumable background indexing so Media Usage can safely catch up on existing content without processing the whole site at once.

- [#2512](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2512) [`515c08d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/515c08d17c1a65e3cf93b27a699956fa4c704e56) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds scheduler heartbeat health to the admin dashboard and warns when scheduled content is overdue because maintenance has never run or has stopped running.

- [#2422](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2422) [`e28963b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e28963b07c5ffc06e2d4d1660f74b13e9211cf6e) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds resource limits to durable Media Usage indexing so already-oversized changed projections are rejected before the worker updates their index.

- [#2460](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2460) [`d236776`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d23677619520442d40cc28e532099aac5efbab5b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes publishing collections without revision support so current content remains intact.

- [#2459](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2459) [`6602ae0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6602ae05bc23e17642e4dd1179abb6465e20491d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes live collection filters so taxonomy names attached only to other collections no longer override matching content fields.

- [#2427](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2427) [`6d29cee`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6d29ceefdb4adc8a5f2999b5703abd01cea6e27c) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Fixes MCP taxonomy term pagination so manually ordered terms are returned without gaps or duplicates.

- [#2324](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2324) [`c9d5ebd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c9d5ebd61e86083e168446f3abfe1dc47b893754) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes retention of superseded media-usage projection generations during scheduled maintenance.

- [#2312](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2312) [`a159b44`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a159b445d42465a3ff0f2e9a9d0b18ec51a34e1d) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Adds a byline filter to the admin content list. Pick one or more bylines to see entries credited to any of them, or filter to entries with no byline assigned. Bylines inferred from an entry's author are ignored unless you turn on "Include inferred bylines".

- [#2191](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2191) [`9e74e59`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9e74e59958e54ee69ef7ed3ca7bee6f3485c3126) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Include schema fields marked searchable in admin content-list search, using the collection FTS index when available and a cross-dialect substring fallback otherwise.

- [#2506](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2506) [`5289385`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/52893854997f8811b729eb22c267dfe8b3ee24ba) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes inline taxonomy term creation for Unicode-only labels and adds numeric suffixes when generated term slugs collide.

- [#2313](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2313) [`be283e2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/be283e286f2fbd5367d1823b13b6141889f5f9e7) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes full-text search matching Portable Text's internal JSON instead of just prose. Searches for structural tokens like "normal", "span", or "block" no longer match documents whose visible text doesn't contain them, and search snippets show prose instead of JSON fragments. Existing search indexes are rebuilt automatically by a migration on upgrade — no manual reindex needed.

- [#2314](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2314) [`3d89f87`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3d89f87c449c763a5c99934f3dd90753ab7af660) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes content saves re-tokenizing the full search index even when nothing searchable changed. Metadata-only saves (status changes, scheduling, autosave version bumps) no longer rewrite the FTS index, cutting save CPU and write-ahead-log volume on large documents. Existing deployments pick up the guarded triggers through the FTS rebuild migration.

- [#2489](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2489) [`13db62c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/13db62c82fbd0fc7b5784e46aa1e03b5c56eeffc) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes file fields to accept persisted media references with incomplete cached metadata while preserving provider data and legacy URLs.

- [#2504](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2504) [`cd4268d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cd4268d1d114e827124810a09fe4edc27aa5f784) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes image processing hangs caused by malformed ICNS, HEIF, and JXL headers in media and plugin artifacts.

- [#2500](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2500) [`5394ecd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5394ecd0988e941fc1c2c8e97db67a70122c955d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes live-loader entries to expose explicit byline credits through `data.bylines` and `data.byline`.

- [#2402](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2402) [`49bc75e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/49bc75efb134d12a27a5f45d2c78fc63894d48eb) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Fixes the editor's word-count footer showing English in every admin language. The word, character, and reading-time metrics now go through the translation catalogs and use each language's plural rules.

- [#2218](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2218) [`8300c64`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8300c64e8b6004b8895e0886543c24cd91b05225) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Updates media management and selection throughout the admin with clearer asset details, previews, and editing workflows, while keeping stored image metadata consistent across validation and generated types.

- [#2466](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2466) [`4e76317`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4e7631797839759ca057c0c9c6fb3cf7f9611a82) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Fixes a crash that made publishing content fail with an internal error.

- [#2501](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2501) [`ed1e79c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ed1e79c0ab21ccdfd35908bd5296280b05932b86) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes public menu rendering so content and taxonomy links are resolved in batches instead of issuing database queries for each item.

- [#2458](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2458) [`7385d43`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7385d434caca3faea8752fc454a21f89bc920fca) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes content saves accepting repeater values that violate item limits or nested field requirements.

- [#2511](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2511) [`40953d0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/40953d0859c4f273b413b110edd74b810eec0cfb) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds scheduler-wiring diagnostics to `emdash doctor`, with actionable fixes for missing Cloudflare Cron Triggers and scheduled handlers.

- [#2433](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2433) [`0cd7c73`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0cd7c73b9a945df10e268545c65ec2b620443e94) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes collection deletion so it can safely resume after an interruption and clean up related Media Usage data in the background.

- [#2502](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2502) [`9b99822`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9b998224a5305aea15456d101eae023ba1cb191d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes inline Portable Text editing so dropping or pasting files no longer navigates away from unsaved work and instead explains how to insert images.

- [#2493](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2493) [`2398b8d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2398b8d1bde05f3ffb8b4dc5eb01496e1fc60fda) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes Portable Text editing so content with unsupported marks is blocked with a clear error instead of silently losing those marks.

- [#2457](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2457) [`d7fe781`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d7fe781ed9dd66d0d33ecb9f7c7911da12aa8557) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes concurrent content saves so revision pruning cannot remove newly created draft revisions.

- [#2461](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2461) [`598e6fb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/598e6fb95f36a1d4c91417e3e3993ba2f5a53129) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes taxonomy assignments so adding or removing a term from one content translation updates every locale while preserving existing assignments during upgrade.

- [#2385](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2385) [`8008772`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8008772849d943eaace66c0c4d051a453078e6f9) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Skips the default `/sitemap-[collection].xml` route injection when the host site defines its own, matching the existing behaviour for `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.

- [#2394](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2394) [`170c966`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/170c9669785cdc481fcfba01f744d75c08c248f7) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds bounded controls for listing and retrying durable Media Usage indexing work.

- [#2250](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2250) [`4831f77`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4831f77454be4bdacc839d7025f4f6021a8d473f) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes the default media upload allowlist accepting `image/svg+xml` via its bare `"image/"` prefix match, with no upload-time content validation for SVG. A logged-in Contributor+ user could upload an SVG containing an embedded `<script>`; the global allowlist now enumerates safe raster types (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`) explicitly instead of prefix-matching all `image/*`. Fields that explicitly configure `image/svg+xml` in their own `allowedMimeTypes` are unaffected.

- [#2410](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2410) [`5a5adb7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5a5adb79d268bc5305d0c2145aba47489c83a269) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Fixes text alignment on public pages. Text centered, right-aligned, or justified in the editor now renders that way instead of falling back to the default alignment.

- [#2494](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2494) [`ae87ce8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ae87ce8772926d88ff3cb4f3f7961577571552b2) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes plugin content updates in revision-enabled collections so writes are staged as drafts and preserved when published.

- [#2498](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2498) [`48806e2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/48806e224b0e6a2815905f84144c2fe6cdda1f81) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes plugin-created content to use an explicit or configured default locale instead of always falling back to English.

- [#2488](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2488) [`144e378`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/144e3781611a2c7e39bf42b90fdd86435b1a3bdc) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes taxonomy definitions and terms created without a locale so they use the site's current default locale, and warns when historical taxonomy rows use unconfigured locales.

- [#2136](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2136) [`6d9a0d5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6d9a0d54c0ee04fa286a83cd1e2d54fdc8fa594a) Thanks [@dchaudhari7177](https://github.com/dchaudhari7177)! - Standard-format plugins (`definePlugin(...)`) run trusted via `plugins: []` now receive the public single-arg `RouteContext` in their route handlers. Previously the in-process adapter always used the sandboxed two-arg calling convention, so a handler written against the exported `RouteContext` API got only `{ input, request, requestMeta }` at runtime — `ctx.storage`, `ctx.email`, `ctx.kv`, and every other capability surface were `undefined` and any route touching them threw. Sandbox-format entries (no `id` on the default export) keep the two-arg flattened convention unchanged.

- [#2508](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2508) [`5c216c2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5c216c2f9253048e55eef676d3438b0eabbb28a7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes localized taxonomy assignments so the editor shows the configured default-locale variant or an unresolved translation prompt instead of hiding the assignment, and identifies the stored content locale and implicit English default.

- Updated dependencies [[`6a77862`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6a7786217adee382c92af4cf5e26f3bae6aa0de8), [`515c08d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/515c08d17c1a65e3cf93b27a699956fa4c704e56), [`5224b57`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5224b5711ae36f6302e01abdcba586c615a03b16), [`2d5fb0b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2d5fb0bccdff34de6935d5cd59bca967a8974dc4), [`a159b44`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a159b445d42465a3ff0f2e9a9d0b18ec51a34e1d), [`f8a4fce`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f8a4fcefd297da15658b919a4d91109605e8f7b3), [`7708015`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/77080152dba81a6a4f00a1f9702adffccdaf97f9), [`5289385`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/52893854997f8811b729eb22c267dfe8b3ee24ba), [`592a0e3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/592a0e37c6f53d93f760fcd2d987afa97605f90d), [`13db62c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/13db62c82fbd0fc7b5784e46aa1e03b5c56eeffc), [`fefb702`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fefb702763f2cbd3921124ef3358e7cac3f9dd64), [`49bc75e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/49bc75efb134d12a27a5f45d2c78fc63894d48eb), [`8300c64`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8300c64e8b6004b8895e0886543c24cd91b05225), [`2398b8d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2398b8d1bde05f3ffb8b4dc5eb01496e1fc60fda), [`964f51e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/964f51e5daf70752b4c71e667cb62d15b94c4c27), [`318b821`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/318b82192773e678a0b02dcf6efd0ee87f665cc3), [`4c565ea`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4c565ea7f99d62f423aa0f61e183f3da37dd8925), [`5828233`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/582823328ea2d205c72e25d3456029a4c49e649d), [`5c216c2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5c216c2f9253048e55eef676d3438b0eabbb28a7)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#2267](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2267) [`e8048e4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e8048e40b41e57bfaf9bf12faedaca5df3dcfe4e) Thanks [@DavidPivert](https://github.com/DavidPivert)! - Adds an explicit sidebar order for collections. Drag the rows on the Content Types screen, or set `sortOrder` in a seed file, and the admin sidebar follows that order instead of sorting alphabetically by slug. Collections without a `sortOrder` keep the alphabetical order and are listed after the ordered ones, so existing sites look the same until someone reorders. `reorder` is now a reserved collection slug.

- [#2044](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2044) [`534f238`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/534f23884fa1b79ab78a54a382f9acf381919dc6) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Adds `emdash/ui/comments` for `Comments` and `CommentForm` so their CSS only loads on pages that import them. Importing from `emdash/ui` still works but is deprecated and will be removed in 1.0 — prefer `import { Comments, CommentForm } from "emdash/ui/comments"`.

- [#2264](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2264) [`741c40c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/741c40cad671ece2fe4fabf69b08b0a3467527ed) Thanks [@DavidPivert](https://github.com/DavidPivert)! - Adds a `hidden` flag to collections that omits their auto-generated entry from the admin sidebar. Hidden collections keep working everywhere else — REST API, MCP, plugin hooks, and their editor at `/_emdash/admin/content/<slug>` — so a plugin that owns a collection end to end can point editors at its own admin UI instead of a raw CRUD list. Set it in a seed file (`"hidden": true`) or via the schema API.

- [#2353](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2353) [`ea4c39b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ea4c39bb184daf35f98eeb32dc9828bceaff77f0) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Adds manual ordering for taxonomy terms. Move terms up and down from the Taxonomies screen, and term listings — `getTerms()` and the terms REST endpoint — return them in that order. The terms attached to a single entry are still listed alphabetically.

  Existing terms keep the order they display in today, now stored explicitly instead of derived from their labels. Terms added afterwards go to the end of their sibling group rather than slotting in alphabetically — if you want a taxonomy alphabetical, order it that way once and it stays.

  A term's position is shared by all of its translations, so ordering a taxonomy in one locale orders it everywhere. On upgrade that means each taxonomy keeps the alphabetical order of the locale its terms were first written in, and other locales are re-sorted to match; reorder once from the Taxonomies screen if you want something different. Sites that need a genuinely different order per language should use separate taxonomies.

  Also fixes moving a term to a new parent only taking effect in the locale you moved it in, which left the term nested in that locale and still at the top level in the others. Moving a term now moves it in every locale, and terms already split this way are repaired on upgrade.

### Patch Changes

- [#2304](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2304) [`85dd99d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/85dd99d34810261bf25702d2798a9cab2ceeae58) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes sites that don't use bylines paying dead byline lookup queries on every content read. When the bylines table is empty, entries with an author no longer send hydration down the byline query path — the folded result is served directly, removing the wasted round trips from anonymous page renders.

- [#2405](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2405) [`f6385da`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f6385dab2c03ad2da360215c88dac23ff70b9749) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Deprecates `emdash dev` and hides it from CLI help. Existing invocations still work, but now warn you to use the project's `dev` script, such as `pnpm dev`, or run `astro dev` directly.

- [#2349](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2349) [`72660da`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/72660dabdb4a164f01d152741f89c0b7163c4314) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes scheduled content appearing publicly before its staged slug and content are atomically published.

- [#2407](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2407) [`969c6cb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/969c6cb3a50f0d5a951ea98730e2f8133446f44e) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes scheduled maintenance reading the entire revision history on every cron invocation.

- [#2409](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2409) [`0c3af01`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0c3af01baf8263ac744486c6ac481cb0791f6eb5) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes Hyperdrive requests leaving request-scoped pool teardown pending when background layout prefetch outlives the response.

- [#2348](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2348) [`640da63`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/640da63dd06c307cf4d533d63c10da1feadb36f5) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes numbered lists restarting at 1 after intervening content blocks in the editor and rendered pages.

- [#2257](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2257) [`e7c445c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e7c445ca0ee5bc3970909a1c07d41b14de5d3d79) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Adds per-collection search tokenizers so multilingual content can use trigram or non-stemming Unicode search.

- [#2370](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2370) [`ef78aa1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ef78aa1dca816f1e47067554427ac325e73b22b1) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Fixes outbound email links (magic link, invites, signup confirmation, account recovery, comment notifications) ignoring the configured `siteUrl`. The configured origin — `siteUrl` in the integration options or the `EMDASH_SITE_URL`/`SITE_URL` environment variables — now takes precedence over the origin stored during setup, so a site set up on a temporary domain no longer needs a manual database edit to correct its email links.

- [#2408](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2408) [`0237678`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/023767805bbcf6e96fc787a02d52413e460d5257) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes redirect changes remaining stale across Cloudflare Worker isolates by refreshing cached rules within 30 seconds.

- [#2306](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2306) [`e07f0c8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e07f0c842a086dc0f2a8729f5c07ac8f1584af56) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes media-usage tracking rows accumulating without bound. Superseded and abandoned usage generations are now garbage-collected by the periodic maintenance sweep, so the usage table no longer grows with every content save.

- [#2163](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2163) [`425e7c0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/425e7c0fee0e0219bae5cf0e4aa7c8e45dbad19f) Thanks [@dchaudhari7177](https://github.com/dchaudhari7177)! - Plugin API routes with an input schema now work over GET, HEAD, and DELETE. These methods carry no request body, so `request.json()` resolved to `undefined` and every such request failed validation. Route input is now parsed from the URL query string for bodyless methods (repeated keys become arrays) while POST/PUT/PATCH continue to parse the JSON body.

- [#2308](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2308) [`7099d13`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7099d13062c9a36ff68aac2e1e4e85998199481d) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes plugin-declared storage indexes never being created. Indexes declared in a plugin manifest's `storage` section are now materialized on marketplace/registry install and update, dropped on uninstall, and synced for configured plugins on the scheduler tick — so plugin storage queries (like the audit-log dashboard widgets) use an index instead of scanning the whole table. The index shape also changed to a composite that SQLite actually uses on D1, where table statistics are never collected.

- [#2280](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2280) [`f586100`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f58610074b4729a77c032913d21125067d56bf26) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Fixes anonymous public pages reseeding edge/object caches with stale Hyperdrive query results right after content publishes. When `cachedBinding` and a distributed Object Cache are configured, public reads across Worker isolates prefer the uncached Hyperdrive binding for a short window after content writes (default 60s, overridable via `preferUncachedAfterWriteMs` to match your Hyperdrive max_age).

- [#2251](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2251) [`1dd7f13`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1dd7f135a043701effeb164be4f5ae95d106fc78) Thanks [@dchaudhari7177](https://github.com/dchaudhari7177)! - Normalize media values inside repeater image sub-fields. A bare media id posted via the REST API into a repeater sub-field is now normalized into a full `MediaValue` (the same treatment top-level image/file fields already get), instead of being stored verbatim and rendered as "Image not found" in the admin.

- [#2214](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2214) [`447647d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/447647df53098a7c58779f716fd811ffe248271e) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes public routes on `sandboxed: []` (config-declared) plugins requiring authentication regardless of the plugin's own `public: true` declaration. Declare `routes` (and optionally `hooks`) on the plugin's descriptor to have them honored, the same way `adminPages`/`capabilities` already are.

- [#2315](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2315) [`aec4fa1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/aec4fa175a244912e5c1df412d20645ce50365b5) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes renaming a translation taking its canonical page offline. When two locale variants share a slug, renaming either one created a 301 away from a URL the other still serves, making the live page unreachable. Slug-change redirects are now skipped when another entry still holds the old slug.

- [#2328](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2328) [`8040e27`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8040e2792f469ce918ac52e73a2487c284be0d98) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fixes translation lookups reading every non-deleted row of a content table. Content tables now carry `(translation_group, locale)` and `(deleted_at, translation_group, locale)` indexes, replacing the single-column `translation_group` one, so fetching an entry's translations — one entry's, a whole page's, or a menu link's target — seeks straight to the group instead of scanning. The improvement is largest on big collections and on D1, where the query planner has no statistics to fall back on.

- [#2298](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2298) [`8d46fd2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8d46fd29506f9164583853909fce8db705b020f3) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Allows inline code and links on the same text in the content editor, including in headings.

- [#2279](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2279) [`c1f6768`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c1f6768adf2ffb4e09c664d684fc3d49e2b885f0) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Stops draft-only content saves from purging public caches and removes internal revision IDs from anonymous content query results. Public caches are invalidated when live content changes, while preview and edit requests retain the revision metadata needed to load drafts.

- [#2303](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2303) [`ecebade`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ecebade8fb3ff4976c88787595fcb2922c3ee469) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes the Duplicate action creating the copy in the default locale instead of the source entry's locale. Duplicates of non-English entries now stay in their locale — so they appear in the locale-filtered admin list they were duplicated from — and no longer fail with a unique-constraint error when the generated slug already exists in the default locale.

- [#2198](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2198) [`e1ab8f0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e1ab8f08ca262a0b7c981b044cbc52d86f2b7ffe) Thanks [@masonjames](https://github.com/masonjames)! - Fixes missing hreflang links when EmDash UI components are used in bundled Astro deployments.

- [#2331](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2331) [`121b333`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/121b3339b6a2aa1ac86e01bb9ccb5d642af1b620) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fixes the taxonomy term list returning a 500 and rendering empty on Cloudflare D1 when a taxonomy declares six or more collections.

- [#2238](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2238) [`3aabb7b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3aabb7bff8173efabb56ae878a6c2578a7219a10) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fixes taxonomy term counts reading a near-quadratic number of rows on sites with many entries and terms, causing multi-second delays on pages that render term counts or taxonomy filters. Counts are unchanged.

- [#2273](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2273) [`b0c7880`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b0c7880c74994e229b4cf4e9a0247452df2bc640) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes media uploads with native R2 storage, keeps client-side hashing optional, and prevents deduplication from returning media with a different type or size.
  Images larger than 8 MiB skip server-generated placeholders in signed and streamed upload flows.

- [#2243](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2243) [`4a49262`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4a4926267ea625b31975eb22b5c03474e1487eab) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fixes the content editor recomputing taxonomy term usage counts every time it opens. The editor's taxonomy picker never shows counts, but it shares the terms endpoint with the Taxonomies settings page, which does — so opening an entry aggregated the whole content–term assignment table once per applicable taxonomy. `GET /_emdash/api/taxonomies/:name/terms` now takes an `includeCounts` query param (default `true`, so existing callers are unaffected); pass `includeCounts=false` to skip the aggregate, and `count` is then omitted from each term in the response.

Counting term usage aggregates the whole content–term assignment table for each taxonomy, and the layout prefetch ran it for every taxonomy on every HTML response — on Cloudflare D1 this could read millions of rows per page view. Counts are now computed only when a consumer asks for them: the prefetch never does, and the Tags and Categories widgets only when their `showCount` prop is on. `getTaxonomyTerms()` takes a new `includeCounts` option (default `true`) to opt out explicitly, and terms are cached separately from their counts so both callers share one term lookup.

Galleries imported from WordPress now load and stay editable instead of being invisible and lost on save, and you can insert new galleries from the toolbar or with /gallery: pick several images at once reorder them by drag and drop, set the column count, and click any image in the gallery to edit its alt text and caption or replace it. Multiple galleries per document are supported, and gallery blocks render on the public site as before.

### Patch Changes

- [#1588](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1588) [`15d5a45`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/15d5a454c4bdde456819b04ef67fcd846f191ead) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes plugin `content:afterDelete` and `content:afterUnpublish` hooks being dropped on Cloudflare Workers. Cleanup work in these hooks — removing uploaded files, clearing search indexes — now runs to completion after content is deleted or unpublished, instead of being canceled the moment the response is sent. Previously this could also leave plugin storage in a wedged state that hung later admin requests.

- [#2174](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2174) [`c568876`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c568876d78bfcb90d170e03212544a2bda81ddf2) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes locale-filtered content and search results for locales with uppercase region or script subtags. Existing content rows saved with lowercased locale values are repaired automatically.

- [#2140](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2140) [`c4d790e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c4d790e9025b3fdba53953ec720e5e043fd153ab) Thanks [@dchaudhari7177](https://github.com/dchaudhari7177)! - Security: site secrets (`EMDASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `EMDASH_PREVIEW_SECRET`, `EMDASH_IP_SALT`, and their legacy aliases) are no longer read through `import.meta.env`. In production builds Vite statically replaced that expression with the env loaded at build time, which embedded any secret present in `.env` on the build machine into the server bundle and made the stale build-time value silently shadow the real runtime secret (e.g. one set with `wrangler secret put`). The secrets module now reads only the runtime `process.env`. If you previously relied on a secret being baked in at build time, set it as a runtime secret/env var on your deployment platform instead — and rotate any key that shipped inside a bundle.

- [#1954](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1954) [`23a740a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/23a740ad3deb248d00f29559e0cc9c7bfa49ec1f) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a `media_upload` MCP tool that uploads a file from base64-encoded data or a public URL and registers it in the media library, so agent workflows can create media without dropping to the CLI or raw API. Uploads are deduplicated by content hash and respect the global MIME allowlist and maximum upload size.

- [#2007](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2007) [`6fb52b0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6fb52b08139dead03f61324abe1ed10a9e5552e0) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds `emdash media repair-usage` and the `media_usage_repair` MCP tool for repairing content media usage indexes by collection or across all collections; automation should inspect the structured repair status because non-complete results can still be successful invocations.

- [#2092](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2092) [`a27a5cc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a27a5ccda339cc61df452e025e736addbafd1f9a) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds coverage-aware media usage counts and read-only Used in details to the REST API and core client.

- [#1868](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1868) [`4c57ee2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4c57ee216f242ef163ae269ec6ff6abfba716e6f) Thanks [@afonsojramos](https://github.com/afonsojramos)! - Invited users can now accept their invite by signing in with Google or GitHub, instead of only creating a passkey.

- [#2002](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2002) [`e52dea9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e52dea9b72b043d62348f8d01eefade2ce66484c) Thanks [@jcheese1](https://github.com/jcheese1)! - Adds explicitly declared, administrator-enabled plugin MCP tools with per-route permissions, plugin-scoped token access, install and update consent, structured output schemas, and invocation auditing.

- [#1985](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1985) [`3f8b778`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3f8b77822bf8e89b065884c53c7e8b7676788c48) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a `cacheControl` option for public plugin routes: successful GET responses carry the configured `Cache-Control` header, enabling CDN and browser caching for public plugin endpoints. Works for native, standard, and marketplace plugin formats. Private routes and errors keep the `private, no-store` default.

- [#1893](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1893) [`d4c565e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d4c565ef99dde5f0a5fafa55b3ca4353dd6d3168) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds the auto-generated admin settings form for plugins that declare `admin.settingsSchema`. A gear icon on the plugin's card in Plugins opens a form generated from the schema (string, number, boolean, select, secret, url, and email fields), persisted to the plugin's KV store under `settings:` keys. Secret fields are write-only: the admin shows whether a value is set but never returns it. Editing plugin settings requires the `plugins:manage` permission.

- [#1957](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1957) [`65be947`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/65be947258ad22dbd75339e65d1745bb7ebb7c95) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds `defaultTitle` and `defaultDescription` options to `getSeoMeta` so pages with computed titles or descriptions can pass their own fallbacks while values set in the admin SEO panel still take precedence. Previously such pages had to drop down to `getContentSeo` and merge panel values by hand.

- [#1961](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1961) [`e649af8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e649af8a7912bf2331341a5d2a4c5a960d27e422) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds `withEmDashRuntime()` to `emdash/middleware` so request-free handlers (Cloudflare Queue consumers, custom `scheduled()` handlers) can access the EmDash runtime and invoke plugin routes directly — previously the runtime was only reachable through `locals.emdash` on an HTTP request.

### Patch Changes

- [#1505](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1505) [`fbb04ab`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fbb04abcff5b909e28541d3b3e5fca3089870b83) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - The admin shell now falls back to the Site Icon configured in Settings → General for its favicon, so the EmDash backend is branded like the public site. An explicit build-time `admin.favicon` still takes precedence, and the default EmDash mark is used when neither is set.

- [#1901](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1901) [`07c2b0f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/07c2b0f999e35e00153e349f74eb9298669b5fbf) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Fixes same-page anchor links (e.g. `#section`) in Portable Text content opening in a new tab. On-page jumps now always stay in the same tab, even when the link's "open in new window" option is set.

- [#2098](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2098) [`460efe6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/460efe645baae54ee01b5d42643fc9ac5a926ee1) Thanks [@rhaegalll](https://github.com/rhaegalll)! - Fixes API responses to include the `success` field documented in the REST API reference: successful responses are now `{ success: true, data }` and error responses `{ success: false, error }`. The existing `data` and `error` fields are unchanged, so existing clients keep working.

- [#1992](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1992) [`7b9e558`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7b9e5589a79435b8cf069528fdbdb4dd9b8988ae) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes a circular redirect loop when a slug rename is reverted. Renaming a slug back to a previous value now removes the stale redirect that shadowed the restored URL, so the page stays reachable.

- [#2137](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2137) [`aa7ef09`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/aa7ef096c9ab6628920469fb6a4a75bc9b13395f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes the admin boot screen so it respects the saved light or dark theme before the dashboard loads.

- [#1955](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1955) [`c180240`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c18024003340ad5a03076313057284a0f4eea2be) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Fixes `emdash plugin bundle` and `emdash plugin validate` on Windows by importing generated plugin artifacts through portable file URLs.

- [#1979](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1979) [`039c5dc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/039c5dc6d5ecef03bc8be68616234834abdd20cc) Thanks [@masonjames](https://github.com/masonjames)! - Fixes browser uploads for custom S3-compatible storage adapters by allowing their runtime upload origin in the admin Content Security Policy.

- [#2037](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2037) [`b66d8a0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b66d8a086ea9fd02acb34d4fb90c54ea155c7120) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes oversized image renditions on Cloudflare: transforms without an explicit quality were encoded near-losslessly by the Images binding (a 2048px WebP came out ~900 KB instead of ~100 KB). Lossy transforms (WebP/AVIF/JPEG) now default to quality 85, matching Cloudflare's image-resizing default. PNG output keeps no explicit quality — an explicit PNG quality switches the binding to lossy PNG8, which is not a safe default for a lossless format. An explicit `?q=` in the request URL still wins for every format.

  Note: image responses are cached with `Cache-Control: immutable, max-age=31536000` keyed on the request URL, so previously-served oversized renditions stay cached at the edge/browser until they expire. To benefit immediately after upgrading, purge the Cloudflare cache for your `/_image*` URLs (or the whole site cache).

- [#2129](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2129) [`fc6cdfb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fc6cdfbf2e68c23e916518993b229e38868d1510) Thanks [@dchaudhari7177](https://github.com/dchaudhari7177)! - The content API now answers 500 NOT_CONFIGURED instead of 401 UNAUTHORIZED when the EmDash runtime failed to initialize. Previously the permission check ran first, so a server fault (broken DB binding, init failure) was reported as an authentication error even for requests carrying a valid token — and retry logic correctly treating 4xx as non-retryable gave up instead of retrying. The 13 affected content routes now check initialization before permissions, matching the schema routes.

- [#2153](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2153) [`8d6b20b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8d6b20b18fe0570c491de45f60eddb86c1bc1fe7) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Stops draft-only saves and autosaves on published entries from advancing `updatedAt`. On revision-supporting collections, staging or discarding a pending draft leaves live content untouched, so sitemap `<lastmod>` and JSON-LD `dateModified` no longer register a modification until Publish actually changes the live entry.

- [#1079](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1079) [`1b1ff42`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1b1ff42c924056806875ab34f39bbb0bc9e60e74) Thanks [@eyupcanakman](https://github.com/eyupcanakman)! - Fixes the admin content list returning a generic `CONTENT_LIST_ERROR` when a collection's backing table is missing the `deleted_at` column. It now returns `COLLECTION_SCHEMA_MISMATCH` naming the affected collection, so the schema problem is visible instead of an opaque failure.

- [#1898](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1898) [`e2c7549`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e2c7549d7b98c6cc97ba47ca6de5dd1b532e9c8f) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes plugin storage `query()` and `count()` failing on PostgreSQL with "operator does not exist: boolean = integer" whenever a `where` filter was supplied.

- [#1945](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1945) [`6c96ac8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6c96ac8b68d6ba514aba51d5a5282c499afc22d6) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes unsaved inline (visual) editor changes being silently lost when navigating away, e.g. via the browser back button. Edits are now flushed with a keepalive request when the page unloads.

- [#1902](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1902) [`7ff08db`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7ff08dbea6407b566dd5ea7c159510fd871e01b9) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes the login, signup, and invite-accept pages showing the stock EmDash mark and name even when a custom `admin.logo`/`admin.siteName` is configured for white-labeling. These pre-authentication pages now render the configured logo and site name (completing the scope approved in [#639](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/639)/PR [#705](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/705), which wired branding into the sidebar and setup wizard but missed the pages users see before signing in), falling back to the default EmDash mark when no custom branding is configured.

- [#2080](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2080) [`de44730`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/de44730990e8a10b70b0a64ed3747f7038a31eec) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Fixes trusted plugin API routes receiving empty site metadata and relative URLs by using the same site context as plugin hooks.

- [#2018](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2018) [`32be60b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/32be60b87f091e24897c78d39b5d15de93946aab) Thanks [@ttmx](https://github.com/ttmx)! - Adds schedulerless cron access, scheduled publication timestamps, and external authentication support to plugin routes.

- [#2152](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2152) [`b22a3d5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b22a3d5cca0b7217bab3f5fa8c90821fa0eb981c) Thanks [@vedanshujain](https://github.com/vedanshujain)! - fix(core): compare plugin-storage numeric filters and ordering numerically on Postgres. `_plugin_storage.data` is a `text` column, so after the `::jsonb` cast ([#1898](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1898)) the extracted value is still text and numeric guards compared lexically — `{ stock: { gte: 10 } }` over 9/10/100 matched 9 (over-count/oversell) and numeric `orderBy` sorted `[10, 100, 9]`. Numeric comparisons now use a type-guarded `::numeric` cast and ordering uses the jsonb-native value, so results are numeric and parity-correct with SQLite. Non-numeric stored values yield no match instead of erroring.

- [#1980](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1980) [`32f8261`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/32f8261fc028dc6941a14d891a83722c8c830209) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes plugin storage `startsWith` queries treating `%`, `_`, and `\` in the prefix as LIKE wildcards instead of literal characters.

- [#2036](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2036) [`4b7fd08`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4b7fd08468caf7897f9c23a238da27cda8cdf171) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes publishing an entry whose staged slug is already used by another entry in the same locale failing with an opaque database error. Publish now returns a validation error naming the conflicting slug and entry, which the admin can show inline, and leaves the live entry untouched.

- [#2082](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2082) [`cf6e4fa`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cf6e4fa5d259c24d7ae3038c55039fc56c6c2923) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Fixes production build warnings when database adapters do not provide the optional cold-start query coalescing dialect.

- [#2084](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2084) [`d303738`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d30373826208bd0182e842d20ca718a78a0585c6) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Avoid production render warnings when Astro's built-in CSP is disabled while preserving JSON-LD script hashes when it is enabled.

- [#1958](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1958) [`6a79b03`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6a79b03e6f11c61098f78b81d878604e2ac903e0) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Warns at build time when `@astrojs/react` is not registered in the Astro config. Without it the admin UI builds successfully but never hydrates, leaving the page stuck on "Loading EmDash..." with no error.

- [#2128](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2128) [`34b3017`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/34b30171b1bca29110b64d6ab317e5145150807b) Thanks [@jcheese1](https://github.com/jcheese1)! - Fixes fresh database setup failures for sites with large seed schemas.

- [#2081](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2081) [`6890edd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6890edd3b82b076da43d43685195321e83f50914) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Fixes sandboxed plugins receiving empty site metadata and relative URLs from `ctx.url()`.

- [#2050](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2050) [`cfdb8f0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cfdb8f00ea18dc728e6e0fb910cc71d56478ea63) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes admin-account recovery when `emdash:setup_complete` is set but the users table is empty (a wiped or sanitised database copied between environments). `/api/setup/status` already resumes the wizard at the admin step for this state, but the admin-step routes rejected it with `SETUP_COMPLETE`, leaving no UI path to an admin account. Both routes now reject on the flag only when a user also exists; the fully-set-up and admin-exists rejections are unchanged.

- [#1845](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1845) [`ca660c6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ca660c6c9043efe115b851d696a12757d9539f25) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes OAuth login (Google/GitHub) failing with "Failed to start OAuth flow" on Astro 6+ Cloudflare deployments. The OAuth start and callback routes read provider credentials via `Astro.locals.runtime.env`, which Astro 6 removed — accessing it now throws instead of returning `undefined`, so the existing optional-chaining fallback never ran. Both routes now read Cloudflare bindings through a build-time virtual module instead, falling back to `import.meta.env` on non-Cloudflare adapters exactly as before.

- [#1838](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1838) [`c4a2ffd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c4a2ffd683a94b2ed015862cd81be9d6e74cdb3d) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes admin forms (e.g. Create Taxonomy) showing a generic "Invalid request data" error instead of the actual validation problem. Field-level validation messages from the server are now shown to the user.

- [#1962](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1962) [`c24b7d3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c24b7d3be5efa95e7874e48360e31fdc8b27a06d) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fixes taxonomy-filtered collection listings reading the entire collection on SQLite/D1 when the term is selective. Such listings now seek the matching entries directly, cutting D1 rows-read from tens of thousands to the page size.

- [#2085](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2085) [`84173dd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/84173dd64ed67da3035f88f37fc573c9fe9753a5) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Watch resolved sandbox plugin entry files so rebuilding a plugin invalidates its embedded virtual module during development.

- [#2030](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2030) [`c350e86`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c350e86d77b9b6b64963bb3d246daa23979feb4a) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes MCP OAuth discovery advertising `http://` URLs on Cloudflare and other proxied deployments. The `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` routes now honor `siteUrl` on anonymous requests, so MCP clients can attach without setting `EMDASH_SITE_URL` as an env var.

### Minor Changes

- [#1535](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1535) [`0360900`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0360900dfa6be62d44d6ce259db1713dae8a4c2e) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Adds an HTTP API for content references: relation-definition CRUD under `/_emdash/api/relations` (editor-readable, admin-writable) and directed reference edges on content entries under `/_emdash/api/content/:collection/:id/references/:relation/{children,parents}` (ownership-aware). References are stored only in the references table — no collection column. The edge reads are cursor-paginated (`?cursor`/`?limit`, default 50, max 100) and return `nextCursor`; each resolved entry carries the `locale` of the variant returned.

- [#1874](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1874) [`1526f96`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1526f96c0728ccaf07ecd295170d0ba18e121e8d) Thanks [@Vallhalen](https://github.com/Vallhalen)! - MCP `content_create` and `content_update` now accept a `taxonomies` field
  (`{ [taxonomyName]: [termSlug, ...] }`) that assigns taxonomy terms in the
  same transaction as the content write. Term slugs are resolved in the entry's
  locale via the same code path as the `/terms/{taxonomy}` REST route, so the
  two entry points can't drift. Also exposed on the REST `POST` and `PUT`
  content endpoints for parity. Fixes [#953](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/953).

- [#1719](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1719) [`7c5de08`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7c5de08f6370ea88500b7ec425d58b2c82443260) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a `taxonomies:read` plugin capability with read-only taxonomy access: plugins that declare it get `ctx.taxonomies` to list taxonomy definitions (`getAll()`), fetch the terms of a taxonomy (`getTerms()`), and read the terms assigned to a content entry (`getEntryTerms()`) — in-process and in both sandbox runners.

- [#1578](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1578) [`58f594b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/58f594b59641649a445231b56a2dfbdcab434611) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Implements pagination for `search()` and `searchCollection()`

  `search()` advertised keyset pagination through its types (`options.cursor`, `SearchResponse.nextCursor`) but never read the cursor or returned one, so results were silently capped at `limit` with no way to load a second page.

  Both `search()` and `searchCollection()` now honour `cursor` and return a `nextCursor` whenever more matches exist. Pass the previous `nextCursor` back as `cursor` to walk subsequent pages; it becomes `undefined` on the last page. The `/_emdash/api/search` endpoint accepts a `cursor` query parameter and returns `nextCursor` in its response (a malformed cursor returns a 400 `INVALID_CURSOR`).

  ```ts
  let cursor: string | undefined;
  do {
  	const { items, nextCursor } = await search("quarterly report", {
  		limit: 20,
  		cursor,
  	});
  	render(items);
  	cursor = nextCursor;
  } while (cursor);
  ```

- [#1867](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1867) [`c57b12b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c57b12ba07ef381e90d132b32aab3ac7b3b3351a) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds an admin REST endpoint and `EmDashClient.mediaRepairUsage()` client method for repairing content media usage indexes by collection or across all collections.

- [#1886](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1886) [`60811c0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/60811c0313096dd485ee9075a0186eb51fc57ca6) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a `toolbar` config option for reliable editor-toolbar delivery behind shared caches. `toolbar: "client"` keeps public HTML identical for every visitor and shows a client-side "Edit" pill for logged-in editors that opens a fresh, uncached editor render via an `_edit` query param; `toolbar: false` disables the toolbar entirely. The toolbar can now also be dismissed in the browser via its × button. The default (`"server"`) is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#1865](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1865) [`582ea2c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/582ea2c6d970ff8f7224c46fbe9cf2b7cc2470ef) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes the admin dashboard scheduled-content summary so it counts entries with pending schedules instead of inferring the count from other statuses.

- [#1857](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1857) [`77e8968`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/77e8968d906cb4c6cb76c095c7b758a120d6a017) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Speeds up the admin content-list search on collections with full-text search enabled: the filter is now served from the FTS5 index (token-prefix matching plus slug-prefix lookup) instead of scanning every row. Collections without search enabled, and PostgreSQL databases, keep the previous substring matching.

- [#1905](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1905) [`e12f393`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e12f393fcb70255a5fe74c2ee7ad4f7c23e0bbfd) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes multi-paragraph blockquotes splitting into separate quotes: consecutive quote paragraphs now render as a single blockquote on the site and load as one quote block in the editor, so merging them no longer reverts on reload.

- [#1854](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1854) [`e4e76f5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e4e76f5a5511c5ad42e40b112201d0f426186149) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes comment submissions bypassing Turnstile: when the `EMDASH_TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` (or `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`) environment variable is set, the public comment endpoint now verifies the submitted Turnstile token server-side and rejects submissions without a valid one. Sites without a configured secret key are unaffected.

- [#1550](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1550) [`cbc7d6b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cbc7d6b806e993e7a51c47ffa4abb9b31b3d61f5) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes search across all collections failing with `D1_ERROR: no such column: c.title` when any search-enabled collection has no `title` field ([#1178](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1178)). `title` is an optional field, not a guaranteed column, so calling `search` (or the MCP `search` tool) without a `collections` filter could error instead of searching everything. Cross-collection search now works regardless of which collections define a title; results from a collection without one simply omit the title, and autocomplete suggestions skip such collections rather than erroring.

- [#1907](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1907) [`15f4057`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/15f4057abf0c55a36396d4b8f05e818277b01898) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds hreflang alternate links to the page head for translated content. `<EmDashHead>` now emits a `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="...">` per published translation (plus `x-default`) automatically, and a new `getHreflangAlternates()` helper resolves the same set for hand-rolled heads.

- [#1875](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1875) [`b116525`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b116525425d3687cfe1356704e71ce27832d1db7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes a database stampede on Postgres when a pending migration fails at runtime: requests no longer pile up waiting on the migration lock, failed migrations are retried with a backoff instead of on every request, and failed attempts no longer leak idle database connections.

- [#1855](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1855) [`450ea81`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/450ea810aff6b6dfa3797bb99155386189a8a853) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes preview and editor-toolbar responses being stored in the shared edge cache when route caching is enabled: requests with a `_preview` token and toolbar-injected editor pages now opt out of the route cache, so draft content is no longer served from the cache without token verification and toolbar markup no longer leaks to anonymous visitors.

- [#1892](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1892) [`9c0733f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9c0733f6f54aa250039a5d0da29b8d8aa9d144cf) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes taxonomy term counts (Categories/Tags widgets, term pages, and the admin term list) so they only include content that is publicly visible: published or scheduled-and-due entries that have not been trashed. Counts are now also scoped to the taxonomy's declared collections.

- [#1863](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1863) [`9e4701e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9e4701e89cffd77e98ea10f46731c47e2815b4e6) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes a privilege escalation on private plugin API routes: an editor (or a cross-origin page) could invoke admin-only, state-changing plugin routes by sending them as `GET` or `HEAD` instead of `POST`, which bypassed the permission tier and CSRF check. Every private plugin route now requires `plugins:manage` and the CSRF header regardless of HTTP method.

### Minor Changes

- [#1849](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1849) [`b36d15c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b36d15c1523dc6e0ada57b4c838f8948b3fbd4fa) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes "Worker exceeded resource limits" when importing large WordPress sites on Cloudflare. The plugin import now runs as a sequence of small requests — content pages, then comments, then menus and site identity — with a live progress bar instead of an indefinite spinner, and media files upload in bounded batches. An interrupted import can safely be re-run: already-imported content is skipped and the import fast-forwards to where it stopped.

- [#1830](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1830) [`15b4d2d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/15b4d2d189142abb69f5c9223c4c1f10363e837f) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Improves WordPress plugin imports: taxonomy terms and assignments (custom post type taxonomies are created as EmDash taxonomies automatically, scoped to the collections they map to), Yoast/Rank Math SEO titles and descriptions, ACF and custom meta fields (suggested as collection fields during analysis and populated on import), navigation menus, and comments (with authors, dates, threading, and approval status) are now imported. Site identity — title, tagline, logo, and favicon — is taken over from the WordPress site, replacing the starter template's placeholders. Internal links in imported content are rewritten to root-relative URLs so they stay on the new site instead of pointing back to the old WordPress domain. Fetches the full media library instead of the first 500 files, supports sites with plain permalinks via a `?rest_route=` fallback, and the import screen accepts a migration key generated by the EmDash Exporter plugin wizard.

### Patch Changes

- [#1741](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1741) [`1866fa3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1866fa346e1d4178c60db0fa437b65c0965b1475) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Sets `Cache-Control: private, no-store` on the admin shell response so shared caches never store the admin HTML. Without an explicit header, caches that apply RFC 9111 heuristic freshness (for example Cloudflare's Workers Cache) could store an authenticated 200 and replay it to anonymous visitors instead of the login redirect.

- [#1738](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1738) [`a3ec23d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a3ec23ddc36889e16a967049de233f21432165a6) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes admin media uploads to S3-compatible storage (R2, S3, Minio, etc.) being blocked by the Content-Security-Policy when the storage endpoint is a different origin than the site. The signed upload URL's origin is now allowed in `connect-src`.

- [#1726](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1726) [`cdca719`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cdca7194b2509993fbb1fc3c39e2e70c8d796ad7) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fixes slow collection-list pages on SQLite/D1: folded taxonomy-term hydration now drives its subquery from the content–taxonomy pivot instead of scanning every term in the locale per row, so list pages no longer read tens of thousands of rows on sites with large taxonomies.

- [#1837](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1837) [`ee5bfe6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ee5bfe6b479b736e0432a4d614f5efa01fce02e7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Updates EmDash image rendering to use Astro's responsive image component for local media with known dimensions while preserving provider images and placeholder behavior.

- [#1746](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1746) [`a9e9dde`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a9e9dde98a9433a1c186490a24865587f1774fd9) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds the internal media usage index foundation for upcoming usage-aware media workflows. This creates the usage index schema during migrations but does not change Media Library behavior yet.

- [#1746](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1746) [`a9e9dde`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a9e9dde98a9433a1c186490a24865587f1774fd9) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds internal media usage index hardening for future reference tracking.

- [#1846](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1846) [`7d16d95`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7d16d955003079c8c4a3093decf56bd4f4f05f8a) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds internal media usage repair foundations for future usage-aware media workflows.

- [#1810](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1810) [`dd05063`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/dd050637323731fe7795dbc9cf0c3edd906d6908) Thanks [@masonjames](https://github.com/masonjames)! - Fixes menu items added via the admin content picker from a custom collection linking to the collection archive (`/projects/`) instead of the selected entry (`/projects/widget-co`). Entry references now resolve like page and post items, including `urlPattern` support and per-locale resolution; items whose referenced entry no longer exists are hidden instead of pointing at the archive. Archive links (collection items without an entry reference) are unchanged.

- [#1822](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1822) [`e2dd273`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e2dd2738404b7df57ca5e1d50d31b222218d3734) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes object-cache reads hanging indefinitely after a request was cancelled mid-read. A namespace epoch read started by a request that disconnects (for example a bot aborting on a 404) could leave a never-settling shared promise behind, wedging every later read of that namespace until the isolate was recycled. Waiting requests now bound the shared read with their own timer, dead reads are reclaimed after a deadline, and in-flight reads survive the originating request's cancellation where the platform allows.

Previously the query planner scanned every term in a locale to resolve a single taxonomy, so pages rendering several facets paid a full-locale scan per facet on sites with large taxonomies. A forward-only migration adds the index and drops the now-redundant single-column name index.

### Minor Changes

- [#1707](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1707) [`e4eab4f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e4eab4fba69f1cf249db192938d397aa1b116015) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Brands the admin with the site's own title when no build-time `admin.siteName` is configured. The admin sidebar previously always showed "EmDash", so operators running several EmDash backends couldn't tell them apart at a glance. The manifest now falls back to the Site Title (Settings → General, then the title captured during setup), WordPress-style. An explicit `admin.siteName` still wins, and sites with neither keep the "EmDash" default.

- [#1711](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1711) [`386faf5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/386faf5bd724ce0b47240e9176c92f554fd66c00) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Excluding sample content when seeding (`emdash seed --no-content`, or unchecking "Include sample content" in the setup wizard) now also skips the seed's sample bylines and taxonomy terms, so a schema-only setup starts with no sample data at all. Taxonomy definitions, collections, menus, and other structure are still applied. The dev-only setup bypass endpoint accepts `?content=0` to do the same.

### Patch Changes

- [#1284](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1284) [`7422460`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7422460adf85863abfc27e8f83ba0cb40a3e942a) Thanks [@eyupcanakman](https://github.com/eyupcanakman)! - Fixes statically-sandboxed plugins (registered via `sandboxed: []` in `astro.config.mjs`) being absent from the admin Plugins screen. They are now listed alongside trusted and marketplace plugins, and can be fetched, enabled, and disabled through the same plugin management API.

- [#1387](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1387) [`46ef945`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/46ef945d5fcffeef4ac9aecd2fb63fcb49c24b65) Thanks [@auggernaut](https://github.com/auggernaut)! - Adds LiveSearch route templates and search page navigation options.

- [#1388](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1388) [`cff8498`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cff84987c679faa61bf491c630b3f77d0083ca21) Thanks [@auggernaut](https://github.com/auggernaut)! - Fixes public LiveSearch autocomplete requests being blocked by auth middleware.

- [#1708](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1708) [`dea8210`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/dea82106602bb6dde0edd8c007a5acfa5fd7600d) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes slug-change 301 auto-redirects not being created for published entries in revision-supporting collections. Editing a published entry's slug in the admin stages the change as `_slug` inside a draft revision; on "Publish", `ContentRepository.publish()` synced the new slug straight into the content table — bypassing `handleContentUpdate`, the only place auto-redirects were created. Since collections support drafts + revisions by default, the advertised "Auto: slug change" redirect effectively never fired for the standard editing flow, silently breaking old URLs. Publishing now leaves a 301 from the old URL behind whenever an already-published entry's slug changes. First publishes are excluded (a draft's URL was never public), and direct API slug updates behave as before.

- [#1702](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1702) [`90ffe40`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/90ffe40a1a31193b2f29ef92202e4f339a2487fa) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Restores the `idx_content_taxonomies_term` index on SQLite/D1 installs that lost it when migration 036 was retried after a partial apply, so taxonomy reverse-lookups are indexed again. The index is now recreated unconditionally during 036 to prevent the same loss on any future partial apply.

- [#1710](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1710) [`2a7063a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2a7063a4e44a7ebb770f1cb28acb5bffac15fca2) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes MCP tools and content writes failing in Cloudflare dev servers with `The file does not exist at ".../deps_ssr/..."` after Vite re-optimizes dependencies, which previously required a dev server restart. Also pre-bundles the migration runner, image transform endpoint, and `astro/zod` so the first setup, image, or content request no longer triggers a mid-session re-optimization and worker reload.

### Minor Changes

- [#1659](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1659) [`facdcfc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/facdcfc745059a6f183581963fcc29c8b6efec63) Thanks [@ttmx](https://github.com/ttmx)! - Adds content scheduling hooks for plugins to react when entries are scheduled or unscheduled.

- [#1695](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1695) [`5dea403`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5dea4035ec2f15fa2248e1621386a91320d50f6d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Updates EmDashHead JSON-LD rendering for Astro CSP compatibility.

  Sites using `<EmDashHead />` do not need to change anything. JSON-LD structured data is still rendered automatically, but EmDash now registers the generated script hashes with Astro's CSP runtime API so strict CSP can allow them.

  This also adds `renderPageMetadata(metadata, { includeJsonLd: false })` for advanced integrations that render metadata manually and want to handle JSON-LD script tags themselves. The default remains unchanged: calling `renderPageMetadata(metadata)` still includes JSON-LD script tags in the returned HTML string.

### Patch Changes

- [#1661](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1661) [`f44a277`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f44a2775c8e87be1398befcb29da6bec28bad01c) Thanks [@greymoth-jp](https://github.com/greymoth-jp)! - The editor footer now counts CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters in its word count and reading-time estimate. Because these scripts have no spaces between words, the footer previously counted a whole paragraph as a single word and showed "1 min read" for long CJK drafts, even though the published page reported the correct reading time. The footer now matches the published reading time for CJK content; English and other space-delimited text is unchanged.

- [#1561](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1561) [`971c627`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/971c6271e810a8e12e63303778a132a48eb75f4a) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes datetime fields becoming unsavable through the admin editor ([#1368](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1368)). A `datetime-local` input (or a seed) produces a naive value such as `2026-06-04T18:30:00` with no `Z` suffix or timezone offset, which the field validator rejected — and because the editor re-sends every field on autosave, an entry holding such a value could no longer be saved. Datetime fields now accept naive values (with or without seconds), values with a `Z` suffix or an explicit offset, and date-only values, while still rejecting non-dates.

- [#1560](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1560) [`e5b95e1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e5b95e195e1307237db9eb26806c54c76cc0f81d) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes a cryptic build failure when a configured plugin has no resolvable entrypoint ([#1416](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1416)). Passing an inline `definePlugin({...})` result directly to `plugins: []` previously failed deep in the bundler with an unhelpful "failed to resolve import" error. The build now fails fast with a clear message that names the offending plugin and explains that `plugins: []` entries must resolve to a file or package entrypoint — move the plugin into its own module and reference it from there.

- [#1603](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1603) [`13b87b7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/13b87b70296443db14bf163cd3b25ff2a5701227) Thanks [@Vallhalen](https://github.com/Vallhalen)! - Fixes silent `null` entries on wide-schema collections under Cloudflare D1. The content loader's single-query `LEFT JOIN _emdash_seo` added 5 alias columns to every result set, which pushed collections with ~95+ flat user fields past D1's per-query column limit (~100). The query failed with `D1_ERROR: too many columns in result set`, the error was wrapped as a generic `Failed to load entry`, and the call site surfaced `null`. SEO is now folded into a single aggregated JSON column (mirroring how byline and taxonomy hydration already work), keeping the result-set width bounded regardless of how wide the collection schema gets while preserving the single round trip.

- [#1542](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1542) [`8f7604d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8f7604dfd8f274b7a62bcbccd53068930b304777) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes a crash that returned HTTP 500 on every route on Cloudflare Workers when native plugins are registered with `definePlugin` (`Cannot access 'SIMPLE_ID' before initialization`). Plugin registration is now safe regardless of bundle ordering.

- [#1554](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1554) [`3d80be5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3d80be5e0f1e91844bcf138dea8e86861bc484b4) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes collection `where` taxonomy filters matching nothing when filtering a non-default locale by its localized term slug. Term slugs now resolve in the active query locale ([#1480](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1480)).

- [#1674](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1674) [`d1116ae`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d1116ae6d02f5c15ea5efb68cce78bb24f13ccb6) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds the internal media usage index foundation for upcoming usage-aware media workflows. This creates the usage index schema during migrations but does not change Media Library behavior yet.

- [#1399](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1399) [`192741f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/192741f9a34ede62e23c3de63e3b2483f0b948b6) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Cut per-render D1 round trips on public pages by caching taxonomy definitions across the worker isolate, and harden the runtime/DB singletons against bundler module duplication.

  Every public render that hydrates entry terms read `SELECT * FROM _emdash_taxonomy_defs` (via `getTaxonomyDefs` → `getCollectionTaxonomyNames`), which only had per-request caching. On Cloudflare D1, where the worker colo is often far from the database primary, each query is a ~40ms cross-region round trip, so this fired on every warm request for no benefit — taxonomy _definitions_ change extremely rarely (created via the admin API or a seed; there is no edit/delete-def path). They're now cached per-isolate behind a `globalThis` Symbol holder (the same two-tier pattern as `settings/index.ts` and the byline field-defs cache), keyed by resolved locale and invalidated in-memory by every def write (`handleTaxonomyCreate`, seed application). Invalidation is in-memory rather than a persisted version probe on purpose: a per-request version read would merely replace the query being removed, yielding no net saving on warm isolates. Isolated databases (playground / DO preview) bypass the cache.

  Separately, the cached runtime instance, the DB-instance cache, and the in-flight DB-init promise (`astro/middleware.ts`, `emdash-runtime.ts`) were plain module-scoped variables. Under Vite SSR chunk duplication those can become multiple independent copies, letting cold-start migrations and bootstrap reads re-run on requests that should have hit the warm cache. They now live on `globalThis` behind Symbol keys, matching the existing `SETUP_VERIFIED_KEY` / request-context / request-cache singletons.

  No schema changes, no public API changes, fully backwards compatible.

Installs upgrade automatically; hierarchical (parent/child) taxonomy lookups are indexed again.

These were only generated for direct (local-storage) uploads, so production (R2/S3) media had no placeholders.

  LQIP placeholders are now cached on the stored media value of content fields (alongside `width`/`height`) and on images inserted into rich text, so the `<Image>` component and portable-text image blocks render a blur/color placeholder before the image loads without a runtime lookup.

Timestamps stored via the database default (`datetime('now')` / `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`) or carried in from imports were emitted as a space-separated `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` string, which Google Search Console rejects as "Invalid date". They are now normalized to ISO 8601.

### Patch Changes

- [#1662](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1662) [`942fac6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/942fac6c87d7a6ce3a62ec7e0610887db5a44f3f) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Treats API-token and OAuth-token (`Authorization: Bearer ec_pat_*` / `ec_oat_*`) requests as authenticated when choosing the request-scoped database connection. These requests carry no session cookie, so they were previously classified as anonymous and could be routed to a read replica (D1) or the query cache (Hyperdrive split caching), breaking read-your-writes for API clients. They now use the primary/uncached connection like session-authenticated requests.

- [#1543](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1543) [`38a63d5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/38a63d54e7c7c2735caa179b303c63c175a9570e) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes the admin author filter returning HTTP 500 (`NOT_CONFIGURED` / "EmDash is not initialized") for every collection. The `handleContentAuthors` handler was never exposed on the per-request `locals.emdash` object in middleware, so `GET /_emdash/api/content/{collection}/authors` always tripped its not-initialized guard while sibling content routes worked normally.

Previously, changing a field's type in `seed.json` and re-seeding reported success and bumped the updated count while leaving `_emdash_fields.type`/`column_type` at their old values, so generated types and column mappings went stale with no warning. `UpdateFieldInput` now accepts `type`: a change whose underlying column type is unchanged (e.g. `string` → `slug`, both `TEXT`) is applied, and a change that would alter the column type (e.g. `text` → `portableText`, `TEXT` → `JSON`) is rejected with a clear `FIELD_TYPE_COLUMN_CHANGE` error pointing to the need for a manual content migration, instead of silently corrupting the metadata.

  `getEmDashCollection` now accepts an `offset` option alongside `limit`, so you can render numbered archive URLs like `/page/2` or `/tag/security/page/3` without walking cursors or over-fetching from the start:

  ```ts
  const perPage = 20;
  const { entries, hasMore } = await getEmDashCollection("posts", {
  	limit: perPage,
  	offset: (page - 1) * perPage,
  	orderBy: { published_at: "desc" },
  });
  ```

  Results now include a `hasMore` boolean whenever `limit` is set, so you can show a "next page" link without an extra count query. `offset` is ignored when a `cursor` is supplied — cursor (keyset) pagination still wins.

### Patch Changes

The baseline `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` headers were applied unconditionally, overwriting stricter values a host had already set on its own routes. These headers are now applied only when the host hasn't set them — matching the existing `Content-Security-Policy` behavior — so a host's own values win while EmDash still provides defaults when none are set.

The in-process scheduler now keys off Astro's command rather than Vite's, so plugin cron, scheduled publishing, and cleanup run again.

### Minor Changes

- [#1349](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1349) [`bd6cc3a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/bd6cc3ad2fe29ee8016843168fb8aa1dc38d33de) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - **Breaking:** generated TypeScript interface names in `emdash-env.d.ts` now derive from the collection **slug** (singularized) instead of `labelSingular`. This fixes invalid identifiers (labels with spaces/punctuation) and duplicate identifiers (two collections sharing a label), while keeping names singular so each interface reads as a single entry (slug `posts` → `Post`, `blog_posts` → `BlogPost`). Interfaces are renamed wherever the old label-derived name differed from the slug. Users should regenerate `emdash-env.d.ts` (`emdash types` or dev-server start) and update any direct interface references in their code.

### Patch Changes

- [#1593](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1593) [`b4d7228`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b4d7228d5e28d665a32083ac82ce9346baac639a) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the admin stylesheet leaking onto public routes in `astro dev`. The compiled Kumo/Tailwind theme was injected into every page's `<head>`, overriding host `:root` tokens (`--text-base`, `--text-lg`, ...) and styling otherwise-unstyled pages. The admin shell now loads its stylesheet as a route-scoped `<link>`, so public routes are unaffected — matching production behaviour.

- [#1625](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1625) [`d74269d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d74269d5a538584a1db4ba82e8ab20113cd955e7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Resolves the database connection at use-time for the cron sweep, plugin hook contexts, and media providers instead of capturing it once at startup. This makes scheduled publishing, plugin cron, and database-querying plugin hooks work on connection-backed adapters like Postgres over Cloudflare Hyperdrive, where a connection is bound to the event that opened it. Stateless adapters (D1, Node SQLite) are unaffected.

- [#1617](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1617) [`e39984f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e39984f9ea688faea01b83a611ffe36b6f984a26) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Cuts cold-start latency by batching runtime initialization reads into a single round trip. On a fresh isolate (or Worker), the auto-seed check, plugin-state load, and site-info load now run as one batched query on backends that support it (Cloudflare D1, Durable Objects) instead of several serialized round trips. On D1 this roughly halves runtime init time on cold start. Other backends (Node/SQLite) are unaffected.

- [#1559](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1559) [`280b877`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/280b8771274b2e8f9d0d54b698592ae162374805) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes the editor toolbar leaking into a shared cache ([#1398](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1398)). When a logged-in editor browsed the public site behind a shared cache (such as Cloudflare), responses carrying the injected toolbar could be cached and then served to anonymous visitors, exposing the toolbar markup and the fact that a session was active. Toolbar-bearing responses are now marked `Cache-Control: private, no-store` so they are never shared-cacheable; responses without an injected toolbar keep their original caching.

- [#1553](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1553) [`7fca12f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7fca12f0a8fbe3c1c0f6ea0d2a9826eb51a1da57) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Byline avatar hydration now includes the media LQIP placeholder fields ([#1457](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1457)). Content byline credits already folded in the avatar's `avatarStorageKey` and `avatarAlt` via the media join, but dropped the `blurhash`/`dominant_color` placeholder columns, so author avatars couldn't render a low-quality image placeholder while loading even though the media stored one. `BylineSummary` now also carries `avatarBlurhash` and `avatarDominantColor`, populated by `getContentBylines`, `getContentBylinesMany`, and `findByUserIds` (and surfaced in the byline API response), so themes can paint a blurhash/dominant-colour placeholder for byline avatars exactly as they can for other media.

- [#1613](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1613) [`fd077e0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fd077e0892dedd1eb03c422e07aa54e180ddc0ff) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Fixes a build failure in the `EmDashMedia` component. The component-embed branch contained HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) inside a JSX expression, which the Astro compiler rejects with "Unexpected token", breaking every production `astro build` and returning 500s in dev on any page that renders media. The note is now a JSX comment.

- [#1389](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1389) [`9ebb47e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9ebb47e199a86ba13b9555b8b3e4f7c28f241d63) Thanks [@nanangdev](https://github.com/nanangdev)! - Fixes `emdash export-seed --with-content=all` so it exports content from every collection, matching the documented behaviour. Previously the literal string `"all"` was treated as a collection name and matched none, producing an empty `content` block. The bare flag and `--with-content=true` were the only sentinels honoured.

- [#1616](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1616) [`8c7bc81`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8c7bc81690bd1e3b39ef0bfeb234ea7d3ac49f39) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fixes plugins declaring the `media:write` capability receiving a read-only `ctx.media` with no `upload()`. The plugin context only granted a writable media surface when an internal upload-URL provider was wired, which the runtime never supplied — so `ctx.media.upload()` was always `undefined`. Write access is now granted whenever storage is configured (all `upload()` needs), and `getUploadUrl()` is derived from storage when no provider is set. A `media:write` plugin on a site without storage now logs a warning instead of silently degrading to read-only.

- [#1555](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1555) [`55613e1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/55613e1242a7b11c1dd632c9e50b8bd5f57b2baf) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Plugin route handlers that call `ctx.request.json()` (or `.text()`, `.formData()`, `.arrayBuffer()`, `.blob()`) now get a clear error pointing them to `ctx.input` instead of the runtime's cryptic "Body has already been read" failure ([#1293](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1293)). EmDash parses the request body once before the handler runs and exposes it as `ctx.input`, leaving `ctx.request`'s stream consumed; the request handed to handlers now guards those body-reading methods with an actionable message. All other request members (`url`, `method`, `headers`, `signal`, …) are unaffected.

- [#1396](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1396) [`c5f58b9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c5f58b9a8aeb369baf0b1b0bc2738373c03d2e01) Thanks [@nanangdev](https://github.com/nanangdev)! - fix: render text alignment from rich-text editor end-to-end ([#1201](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1201))

  The previous fix in `text-align-round-trip` patched only the `packages/core/src/content/converters/` pair but the rich-text editor saves through two other ProseMirror ↔ Portable Text converters that each carried their own copy of the same logic — so reporter and maintainer kept seeing alignment dropped on save:
  - `packages/admin/src/components/PortableTextEditor.tsx` (admin save path)
  - `packages/core/src/components/InlinePortableTextEditor.tsx` (in-page inline editing)

  Both now forward `node.attrs?.textAlign` for paragraphs and headings (only `center`, `right`, `justify` — `left` is the editor default and is omitted so existing content stays byte-identical) and restore it on the reverse path. Each editor's local `PortableTextTextBlock` interface gained the `textAlign?: "left" | "center" | "right" | "justify"` field, mirroring the type in `packages/core/src/content/converters/types.ts`.

  The Portable Text frontend renderer now emits a WordPress-style `has-text-align-{value}` class on the rendered `<p>` / `<h1..h6>` / `<blockquote>` whenever the block carries `textAlign`. A new `Block` component is added under `emdash/ui` for callers composing custom Portable Text components who want to keep the EmDash behaviour. The class allowlist is enforced via `Object.hasOwn`, so a hostile or hand-edited Portable Text block cannot inject arbitrary class names.

  Consolidating the three duplicated converter pairs into a single shared module is a follow-up refactor and intentionally out of scope here.

- [#1619](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1619) [`c056060`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c056060cdbf29b823591c5796e38d03a66fcba70) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Speeds up content reads by fetching each entry or collection together with its author bylines and taxonomy terms in one database query instead of three. This cuts time-to-first-byte on hosted databases like D1 where every query is a network round trip.

- [#1406](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1406) [`c43c412`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c43c412500e5bc067371f6e680ff3b7b8a726873) Thanks [@SailingGreg](https://github.com/SailingGreg)! - Honor image alignment from WordPress imports at render and in the editor, and surface display-size controls for migrated images.

  The Gutenberg to Portable Text importer already captured image `alignment`, but it was dropped by the renderer and not editable. `Image.astro` now emits `emdash-image--align-*` classes (left/right float, center, wide/full), the admin editor threads `alignment` through the PortableText/TipTap serializer and image node and adds an alignment control that reflects in the node view, and the Display Size panel now shows for migrated images that carry only display dimensions.

- [#1614](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1614) [`b5ea8e7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b5ea8e70db242472784bd4957e65d5fdb9fecd89) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Fixes request-scoped database adapters that hold a real connection (e.g. Postgres over Cloudflare Hyperdrive) so they work on Workers. `locals.emdash.db` is now resolved lazily, so routes get the per-request connection instead of a snapshot of the shared singleton, and a request-scoped connection is now closed only after the response body finishes streaming rather than before — Astro streams HTML while components still query, so closing earlier broke server-rendered pages. No effect on D1 or other stateless bindings.

- [#1396](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1396) [`c5f58b9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c5f58b9a8aeb369baf0b1b0bc2738373c03d2e01) Thanks [@nanangdev](https://github.com/nanangdev)! - fix(core/converters): persist text alignment from rich-text editor through ProseMirror ↔ Portable Text round-trip ([#1201](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1201))

  `prosemirrorToPortableText` now reads `node.attrs.textAlign` for paragraphs and headings and forwards it into the Portable Text block. `portableTextToProsemirror` restores it back into ProseMirror node attrs. The `PortableTextTextBlock` type gained an optional `textAlign?: "left" | "center" | "right" | "justify"` field. Left alignment is not persisted (it is TipTap's default and would bloat existing content).

### Minor Changes

- [#1540](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1540) [`cf17c9f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cf17c9f4c8faa46857d92d4b168452d2469dba4b) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Add comment reactions

  Visitors can now react to approved comments (positive-only "like" by default,
  extensible to other reaction types). Reactions are deduped per voter via IP hash.

  The `<Comments>` component gains two opt-in props:
  - `reactions` — render a like button per comment and attach live counts.
  - `sort="best"` — order top-level comments by a Reddit-style Wilson score
    lower bound (`sort="oldest"`, the previous behavior, remains the default).

  Posting is progressively enhanced (a tiny inline script, no framework island)
  and emitted only when `reactions` is enabled, so pages that don't use reactions
  ship zero additional JavaScript. Fully additive and backward-compatible: a new
  table, a new route, and new optional props with behavior-preserving defaults.

- [#1484](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1484) [`d46abfd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d46abfdb739f8d242eddba5ebfda09a8648c8ecf) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Forward declarative `portableTextBlocks` and `fieldWidgets` from standard and sandboxed (from-config) plugins

  Standard- and sandboxed-format plugins could already declare admin pages and dashboard widgets, but their declarative Portable Text block types and field widgets were dropped during adaptation — only native-format plugins surfaced them. Since the admin editor reads these from the manifest, the slash-menu entries and Block Kit forms never appeared for non-native plugins.

  `adaptSandboxEntry` now forwards both for standard plugins and sandboxed plugins resolved from config (the `virtual-modules.ts` codegen path), so those formats can contribute Portable Text blocks and field widgets. The site-side render component (`componentsEntry`) still requires native format, which is unchanged.

  Note: marketplace bundles loaded from R2 are not covered yet — the bundle manifest schema, both `extractManifest()` implementations, and the bundler don't carry these fields, so this is scoped to standard/sandboxed-from-config. Full marketplace support is tracked as a follow-up.

- [#1564](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1564) [`6a97bac`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6a97bacaf6ef8b006b32879e4625ebb48da6f5bd) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds byline management to the MCP server: `byline_list`, `byline_get`, `byline_create`, `byline_update`, `byline_delete`, and `byline_translations` tools, plus a `bylines` argument on `content_create` so credits can be attached at creation time (previously only `content_update` accepted them).

- [#1378](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1378) [`640e60a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/640e60a56e3d3e60925ba4d7a1cf0fbd04b3d5c2) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Add an optional distributed object cache for query results.

  Content reads (`getEmDashCollection`, `getEmDashEntry`, `resolveEmDashPath`) and chrome reads (site settings, menus, taxonomies) can now be served from a fast key/value store instead of hitting the database on every request. This sits beneath the per-request cache and above the database, dramatically reducing read pressure on D1/SQLite — especially valuable on Cloudflare, where KV handles far more requests than D1.

  The cache is **off by default** and fully opt-in. Configure a backend in `astro.config.mjs`:

  ```ts
  import { kvCache } from "@emdash-cms/cloudflare"; // Workers KV (distributed)
  import { memoryCache } from "emdash/astro"; // in-isolate (Node / local dev)

  emdash({
  	database: d1({ binding: "DB" }),
  	objectCache: kvCache({ binding: "CACHE" }),
  });
  ```

  with a matching KV binding in `wrangler.jsonc`:

  ```jsonc
  { "kv_namespaces": [{ "binding": "CACHE", "id": "<namespace-id>" }] }
  ```

  Invalidation is epoch-based and automatic: content, byline, taxonomy, menu, and settings writes bump a per-namespace version, instantly orphaning stale entries (no key enumeration needed). Preview and visual-edit requests bypass the cache, so editors previewing see live content; other reads are served from the cache, which only ever stores published content. After an edit, anonymous visitors may see stale content until isolates pick up the bumped epoch — immediate on the in-isolate memory backend, and on KV bounded by KV's edge-cache propagation (eventually consistent, up to ~60s) plus the `revalidate` window (default 1s, configurable).

  New public API: `cachedQuery`, `invalidateObjectCache`, `invalidateCollectionCache`, `contentNamespace`/`contentNamespaces`, `CacheNamespace`, the `ObjectCache*` types (from `emdash`), `memoryCache()` (from `emdash/astro`), and `kvCache()` (from `@emdash-cms/cloudflare`). Existing sites are unaffected until they opt in.

- [#1549](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1549) [`a623c6b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a623c6b7dbdc82c8562f32a619af23ea147306b6) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes responsive image optimization for storage-backed media on Cloudflare. EmDash now wraps Astro's image endpoint to read media bytes directly from your storage adapter instead of fetching them over HTTP, so `Image` and Portable Text images generate a real responsive `srcset` even when the site is behind Cloudflare Access (previously these 404'd and fell back to a full-size image). This is on by default and also removes an internal HTTP round-trip on Node. Set `images: false` in your `emdash()` config to leave Astro's image endpoint untouched.

### Patch Changes

- [#1579](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1579) [`0bfab91`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0bfab91765514f4a8bd164d7373c8c81e3d5b446) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes a Cloudflare build failure where the bare `zod` import used by the type generator was not externalized, causing the bundler to fail. EmDash sites on Cloudflare now build correctly under Astro 7.

- [#1584](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1584) [`707edee`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/707edee3bdf31b53f33507e1f528a0e5803fd150) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the dev setup-bypass endpoint accumulating duplicate `dev-bypass-token` access tokens. Re-running it (for example after a dev reset) now replaces the previous token with a fresh one instead of adding another row.

- [#1581](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1581) [`a36b5f3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a36b5f3e1e452d48a690878d4f078f85a6d99715) Thanks [@naota70](https://github.com/naota70)! - Fix the setup probe baking a redirect to `/_emdash/admin/setup` into prerendered pages. On a build whose database is empty (e.g. CI/first deploy), the anonymous setup probe saw a missing migrations table and returned `context.redirect("/_emdash/admin/setup")`; a prerendered route serializes that into static HTML and ships the redirect to production. The probe is now skipped entirely when `context.isPrerendered` is true — there is no live visitor to send to the wizard at build time, and the build database is legitimately empty. Live (SSR) requests are unaffected.

- [#1509](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1509) [`ed921d8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ed921d80ec33fa114d9c8a7f9221f1fbeb24d658) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Speeds up public page loads on remote databases (D1, Durable Objects) by eagerly warming site-global layout data (menus, widget areas, taxonomy term lists, settings) at the start of the request, so the layout's per-component reads overlap into roughly one round trip instead of executing serially. Transparent to site code; no template changes needed.

- [#1563](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1563) [`c219aff`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c219aff3b867e178ee267823801db66bbc9b1621) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Lets the MCP `content_create` and `content_update` tools accept a Markdown string for rich text (portableText) fields, converting it to Portable Text automatically — the same behaviour the EmDash client already has. Passing a Portable Text JSON array still works. Authoring rich text as a single Markdown string avoids the large nested JSON payloads that agents frequently emit as malformed JSON, causing the tool call to fail before it reaches the server. `content_get` and `content_list` gain an optional `markdown` flag (default false) that returns rich text fields as Markdown instead of Portable Text arrays.

- [#1580](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1580) [`ca47da4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ca47da485ddcf46f7fa7b8efa15c3c20a11c2300) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes query instrumentation (`EMDASH_QUERY_LOG=1`) so the per-query NDJSON log captures queries issued while the page is still streaming, not just those that ran before the response headers were sent. The per-query log now matches the totals already reported by the `[emdash-stream-end]` summary line.

- [#1538](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1538) [`cb1c689`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cb1c68948072c479ed924b52867809bc8ad1c9e5) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fix logged-in pages hanging indefinitely on Cloudflare Workers ([#1274](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1274)). A request cancelled mid-`session.get("user")` could leave the session-store read as a promise that never settles, poisoning the isolate so every later session-bearing request hung (0-CPU, multi-minute, `canceled`) — reliably reproducible on fresh isolates right after a deploy. Every session read on the request path (the main middleware, the auth middleware, and the preview-snapshot route) now goes through a shared `resolveSessionUser()` helper that anchors the read with `after()` so a cancelled request still drives it to completion (preventing the isolate poisoning), with a fail-closed timeout backstop that degrades a still-stalled read to "unauthenticated for this request" rather than hanging.

### Minor Changes

- [#1382](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1382) [`b6a5fac`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b6a5fac6d3bc88cc5ab49889de264c37262cc5f7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - The Astro dev server now prints absolute, clickable URLs for the admin UI and (when enabled) the MCP server, along with a dev-bypass shortcut link that signs you in as a dev admin without going through passkey setup or auth. The startup banner also shows the installed EmDash version. The dev-bypass link is dev-only and the underlying endpoint returns 403 in production.

- [#1508](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1508) [`e9cd7b7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e9cd7b7821c5a081257cb56bb857b7950e2b1527) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Add a "Gone (410)" rule type. Redirect rules now support `410` (Content Deleted) and `451` (Unavailable For Legal Reasons) as terminal statuses — served directly with no destination — and the 404 log offers a one-click "Mark as Gone (410)" action next to "Create redirect". A 410 tells search engines a URL was intentionally and permanently removed, so it is deindexed faster than a 404.

### Patch Changes

The per-isolate caches for byline custom-field definitions and resolved site secrets could retain a never-settling promise left behind by a cancelled request, which wedged every later request on that isolate until it was evicted. Both caches now cache the resolved value behind a reclaimable single-flight lock, so a cancelled request can no longer stall the isolate.

### Minor Changes

- [#1461](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1461) [`b01aa9b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b01aa9bbb436bcec07516b499eb0516cfbe414b4) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes registry installs failing with "Plugin manifest has changed since you consented" for plugins that declare hook-registration capabilities (email transport, email events, page fragments) or read user records. Plugin bundles now declare their access as a structured `declaredAccess` contract that the registry record, the install-consent dialog, and the sandbox all read consistently, so every capability a plugin declares is shown for consent and enforced — no capability is silently dropped. Re-publish affected plugins to adopt the new bundle format; existing installs are unaffected.

- [#1425](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1425) [`3e344af`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3e344af2c162e37dfa389b9cb88c2c826590b678) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Repeater fields support `image` sub-fields with the media picker ([#1424](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1424))

  Repeater rows previously rendered every non-scalar sub-field as a plain text
  input, so galleries had to be built from hand-pasted URLs. Image sub-fields
  now render the same media-picker UI as top-level image fields (select,
  preview, change, remove) and store the same MediaValue shape — legacy string
  URLs keep working.

  Includes: `image` in the schema-builder sub-field type select, the shared
  `ImageFieldRenderer` extracted out of `ContentEditor` for reuse, and the
  sub-field type whitelists in core (`REPEATER_SUB_FIELD_TYPES` + the API Zod
  enum) extended — the Zod enum also gains the previously missing `url` entry
  that the builder already offered.

### Patch Changes

- [#1447](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1447) [`141aa11`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/141aa11213206d9ea5e14d1f1cd75c07cfacae7b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes `@atcute` peer dependency warnings on install ([#1435](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1435))

  Installing EmDash pulled in mismatched `@atcute` package versions, so `pnpm install` / `npm install` reported unmet peer warnings for `@atcute/identity` and `@atcute/lexicons`. The bundled `@atcute` dependencies are now aligned on v2 and installs are clean. If your project also depends on `@atcute` packages directly, note they have moved to v2 (`@atcute/client` 5, `@atcute/lexicons` 2, `@atcute/atproto` 4, `@atcute/oauth-node-client` 2).

- [#1492](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1492) [`7688f0b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7688f0b6a92ccfdcea6244100c07679e81014161) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes a read-your-writes gap with database read replication: the session bookmark cookie is now persisted even when page rendering throws after a successful write, so an immediately-following request can't read pre-write state from a lagging replica.

- [#1459](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1459) [`c7166b0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c7166b083eaa2ceb37f8d9682f4a521e5e360a19) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Fix scheduled entries staying hidden after their scheduled time ([#1402](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1402))

  `isVisible()` read `scheduledAt` via `dataStr`, which returned an empty string for the `Date` the loader produced, so entries whose scheduled time had passed never became visible. The visibility check now reads the scheduled time correctly.

- [#1458](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1458) [`9c994ad`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9c994ada4692d34517ab458f29b8613aa9341ecc) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Fix `npx emdash types` crash caused by the schema endpoint envelope ([#1188](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1188))

  The `/schema` route returned an enveloped JSON body while `client.request()` already unwraps the `.data` field, so `emdash types` received `undefined` and crashed. The route now returns the un-enveloped shape the client expects.

- [#1489](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1489) [`eddaf91`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/eddaf91a6a818cad12bc8f5e14ee16f8189cc073) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes admin pages hanging indefinitely (and eventually returning 524 timeouts) on Cloudflare Workers. The worker-lifetime caches for site settings and search-index health could be left holding a request that never completed (for example when a visitor's request was cancelled mid-load), which then stalled every later request served by that worker until it was recycled. These caches now keep resolved values rather than in-flight requests, so a cancelled or interrupted request can no longer wedge the rest.

- [#1481](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1481) [`afc3a0f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/afc3a0f6f3f0fa831b6c2e7e8ddebb4a7c631007) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fixes collection `where` filters to apply every taxonomy key instead of silently dropping all but the first. Filtering by two or more taxonomies (e.g. `{ category: ["news"], region: ["emea"] }`) now returns the intersection — entries tagged in each taxonomy — matching how field and byline filters already compose.

- [#1498](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1498) [`3d423a7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3d423a796d7d000160dc7d8d0a582ba7734f214f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Reduces redundant database queries when rendering content pages: widget areas are now request-cached, taxonomy term usage-counts are fetched once per request instead of once per taxonomy widget, and `getTermsForEntries` reuses already-hydrated terms instead of re-querying. Fewer round trips per page on every backend.

- [#1492](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1492) [`7688f0b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7688f0b6a92ccfdcea6244100c07679e81014161) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds an `rpc.count` Server-Timing metric reporting physical database round trips, distinct from `db.count` (logical queries). Backends that batch (the new Durable Objects SQL driver coalesces same-turn reads into one round trip) can now surface how many round trips a request actually made.

- [#1504](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1504) [`8807701`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/880770148329fa14ccb1c35d438ae6e53c8e2c97) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds image entries to per-collection sitemaps. When a content entry has an SEO image, the sitemap now emits it as a Google `<image:image>` entry, helping Google discover and index page images for Google Images.

### Minor Changes

- [#1442](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1442) [`e96587f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e96587f8ff393939355d3d643a322fe7b2c07c86) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Add status, author, and date-range filtering to the admin content list ([#1288](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1288)). The content list API gains `authorId`, `dateField`, `dateFrom`, and `dateTo` query params (all additive and optional), and a new `GET /_emdash/api/content/{collection}/authors` endpoint lists the distinct authors of a collection's content (gated on `content:read`). Filtering runs server-side, so it works across the whole collection rather than only the loaded page.

- [#1439](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1439) [`023893a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/023893a0fa966b95aad4ff533fc2966b3e3dfe03) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Add content filtering by byline credit. `getEmDashCollection` now accepts a reserved `byline` key in `where` that returns entries credited to a byline in any position, including co-authored entries where the byline is a secondary credit. This makes author archive pages possible without querying the database directly. Pass a single byline translation group or an array to match any of several.

  ```ts
  const byline = await getBylineBySlug("jane-doe");
  const { entries } = await getEmDashCollection("posts", {
  	where: { byline: byline.translationGroup ?? byline.id },
  	orderBy: { published_at: "desc" },
  });
  ```

  A `getEntriesByByline(collection, byline, options)` helper wraps the same filter, mirroring `getEntriesByTerm`.

- [#1367](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1367) [`f41092b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f41092bd847f1eb161034f1d2c67976e8473e794) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Add content-reference database schema: `_emdash_relations` (relationship-type definitions, row-per-locale) and `_emdash_content_references` (directed, locale-agnostic edges between content entries linked by `translation_group`). Additive, forward-only migration `043`; no existing tables change. Groundwork for reference fields — no field type, API, or admin UI yet.

- [#1438](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1438) [`850c1b7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/850c1b7e23eb1b083c0fcb753762effa1d3a207a) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Generate responsive `srcset`s for media rendered with the `Image` and Portable Text image components. EmDash now routes locally/R2-stored media through Astro's configured image service (`astro:assets`) -- the Cloudflare Images binding on Workers, sharp on Node -- producing width-appropriate candidates and modern formats (e.g. WebP) instead of a single full-size `<img>`.

  This works automatically:
  - Media served from a configured storage `publicUrl` (R2 custom domain, S3/CDN) is authorized and optimized.
  - Same-origin proxied media (local storage, or R2 without a public URL) is optimized when `siteUrl` is set; the matching `image.remotePatterns` entry is registered for you, scoped to the media route.
  - In `astro dev` it works out of the box without configuration.

  When optimization isn't possible (no image service available, an unauthorized host, or unknown dimensions) the components fall back to a plain `<img>`, so existing sites keep rendering exactly as before. No template changes are required.

- [#1312](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1312) [`c39789c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c39789c383e94125d8874a516988c7d9ca6f5484) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Drive scheduled publishing from a real heartbeat instead of request side effects ([#1303](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1303)).

  Content scheduled via the admin now actually transitions to `published` when its time arrives. Previously nothing promoted the row — `status` stayed `scheduled` and `published_at` stayed null forever.

  A new sweep (`publishDueContent`) promotes due content and runs alongside the existing cron tick and system cleanup:
  - **Node / single-process:** the timer-based scheduler already drives it — no action needed.
  - **Cloudflare Workers:** a `scheduled()` handler driven by a Cron Trigger now runs the sweep. The request-driven `PiggybackScheduler` is gone, so there are no maintenance side effects on visitor requests.

  `@emdash-cms/cloudflare` ships a Worker entry that wraps Astro's handler with the `scheduled()` handler (`@emdash-cms/cloudflare/worker`, plus `createScheduledHandler()` for hand-assembled Workers). When a cache provider is configured, the handler also purges edge-cache tags for whatever it published, so stale snapshots produced before the scheduled time are evicted.

  **Migration for existing Cloudflare sites.** New sites get this from the templates. Existing deployments must update two files:

  ```ts
  // src/worker.ts
  export { default, PluginBridge } from "@emdash-cms/cloudflare/worker";
  ```

  ```jsonc
  // wrangler.jsonc
  "triggers": { "crons": ["* * * * *"] }
  ```

  Without the Cron Trigger, scheduled publishing and plugin cron do not run on Workers.

  Scheduled publishing matches manual publishing exactly: it fires `content:afterPublish` hooks (search indexing, webhooks, syndication), and records the _scheduled_ time as `published_at` on first publication rather than the (later) sweep time. The sweep claims each row atomically before promoting it, so an entry unscheduled or rescheduled just before its time is never published, and overlapping sweeps can't double-publish. Local `astro dev` keeps running the timer-driven sweep even under the Cloudflare adapter (where production relies on the Cron Trigger).

  Each tick promotes at most 100 items per collection (a large backlog drains over successive ticks) so a single Worker invocation can't exhaust its CPU/subrequest budget, and edge-cache tags are purged incrementally after each collection's batch rather than only at the end. On Node, the maintenance interval is capped at 60s so scheduled-publish latency matches the Cloudflare Cron Trigger cadence instead of lagging up to five minutes when no plugin cron is due.

### Patch Changes

- [#1307](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1307) [`cedfcc5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cedfcc527d47131baaa5dcfb29fb7b4a966265d5) Thanks [@emdashbot](https://github.com/apps/emdashbot)! - Read `?locale=` in content write routes (DELETE, publish, unpublish, discard-draft, schedule, unschedule) and forward it to `handleContentGet` for locale-aware slug resolution ([#1242](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1242))

- [#1420](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1420) [`c63f9ca`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c63f9ca56a8fc0cf4e1843887291fee0d78d89a2) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - `getTaxonomyTerms()` now returns the term `description` for flat
  (non-hierarchical) taxonomies ([#1419](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1419))

  The query already fetched the `data` column, but the non-hierarchical branch
  dropped it when mapping rows to `TaxonomyTerm` — only hierarchical taxonomies
  (via `buildTree`) parsed the description. Descriptions set in the admin UI are
  now returned for both kinds of taxonomies.

- [#1426](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1426) [`61ea3c9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/61ea3c9fee5b0f11974895a278d8297c56abec0b) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fix seed CLI hardcoding `en` as the default locale ([#1421](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1421))

  `emdash export-seed` now emits a top-level `defaultLocale` for single-locale
  projects, and `emdash seed` (`applySeed`) honors it when backfilling the locale
  of menus, taxonomies, and content rows that omit an explicit `locale`. Previously
  an `export-seed` → `seed` round-trip silently rewrote a non-`en` default locale
  (e.g. `de`) to `en`, since the CLI runs outside the Astro runtime and the
  fallback collapsed to `en`. Projects whose default locale is `en` are unaffected.

- [#1445](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1445) [`a4c2af2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a4c2af20ee27fef891290a442f7a20d4db64600d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix `getEmDashEntry` / `getEmDashCollection` hydrating taxonomy terms in the request-context or default locale instead of the entry's resolved locale ([#1441](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1441)). When querying with an explicit `locale` (or via a localized route), `entry.data.terms` could return default-locale term variants even though the content row was correctly localized. Term hydration now uses the same resolved locale as the content query.

### Patch Changes

- [#1391](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1391) [`8a766b8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8a766b876117bbb2b7a2179615e83666cdc769e8) Thanks [@mvvmm](https://github.com/mvvmm)! - Add `fetchpriority="high"` to priority EmDash images so above-the-fold images can be requested eagerly and prioritized by the browser.

- [#1405](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1405) [`bdabff7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/bdabff7e4b5fb699ef25002508b7edd3ed184061) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixed a bug where a visitor disconnecting at the wrong moment during a cold start could leave that server instance permanently broken: every subsequent request to it would hang until the platform timed it out (a 524 error on Cloudflare, after 100 seconds), and the instance stayed broken until it was recycled. Sites no longer get stuck — startup now recovers automatically, and in the worst case a request fails fast with an error instead of hanging.

- [#1408](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1408) [`afc065c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/afc065c12e6b9a19c30d2cf179fd1ba9667c5b17) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Faster cold starts. The first request a fresh server instance handles — after a deploy, or when traffic picks up again after a quiet spell — now runs its startup steps concurrently instead of one at a time, shaving database and storage round trips off that first page load. Especially noticeable on Cloudflare, where new instances spin up frequently.

- [#1409](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1409) [`7ee9467`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7ee94677193fb8dd39b87a23b69883f7055ab296) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Pages render with fewer database round trips:
  - Tag and category archive pages load faster — `getTerm()` fetches its details in parallel instead of one query at a time.
  - Pages with several menus (header, footer, …) no longer repeat the same lookup for each menu.
  - Entries fetched with `getEmDashEntry`/`getEmDashCollection` already include their taxonomy terms — you can now read `entry.data.terms?.tag` directly (it's typed in your generated `emdash-env.d.ts`) instead of making a separate `getEntryTerms()` call. The bundled templates have been updated to do this.

- [#1407](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1407) [`f9362d7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f9362d7a89db14420a4a8f7af4e6568f15905ea7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Query instrumentation (`EMDASH_QUERY_LOG=1`) now captures the whole request, not just the part before the response headers are sent. Queries issued by components while the page is still streaming were previously invisible to the Server-Timing numbers; a final `[emdash-stream-end]` log line now reports the complete query count, database time, and cache hits for each request, so you can see where a slow page really spends its time. No effect when instrumentation is off.

### Patch Changes

- [#1356](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1356) [`4e11daa`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4e11daaaf7c07b20903527626391e31799675da8) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Scope Postgres table/column introspection to the connection's active schema instead of hardcoding `public`. `tableExists` and `listTablesLike` (`database/dialect-helpers.ts`) and two idempotency checks in the `019_i18n` migration queried `information_schema` with `table_schema = 'public'`, so a Postgres deployment using a non-public schema (per-tenant or shared-cluster setups) would see tables from the wrong schema or none at all, causing collection/schema operations to misbehave and the i18n migration to skip its column additions. These now use `current_schema()`, matching the already-correct `indexExists`/`columnExists` helpers and migration `038`.

- [#1167](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1167) [`fe6bc78`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fe6bc78e74ecbc41bcae495e070eec9f25e23da2) Thanks [@abhishekshankar](https://github.com/abhishekshankar)! - fix(seo): buildMediaUrl handles root-relative paths without doubling the API prefix

- [#1345](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1345) [`80f2925`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/80f2925bfbc5f4418363c499c36e0a1c1af04242) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Fix frontend pages redirecting to `/_emdash/admin/setup` on a fully set-up site. The anonymous fast-path "setup probe" in the Astro middleware queries `_emdash_migrations` to detect a fresh, un-migrated database, but its `catch` block treated **every** error as "fresh install" — so a transient DB failure (D1 connection loss, replica unavailable, query timeout, cold-start race, locked SQLite) wrongly bounced real visitors to the setup wizard. The probe now only redirects when the error is a genuinely-missing table (via the shared `isMissingTableError` helper) and otherwise renders the page normally. The `setupVerified` flag is also moved onto a `globalThis` `Symbol.for` singleton so it isn't duplicated across SSR chunks, which had caused the probe to re-run far more often than intended (and each re-run was another chance to hit the bug).

### Patch Changes

- [#1328](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1328) [`149fc49`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/149fc4904326174075d100ccb4f203b2a250ec64) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fix `emdash export-seed` omitting bylines. The exporter now emits byline profiles as the root `bylines[]` array (one entry per translation group, since `SeedByline` has no locale axis) and, when content is exported, attaches each entry's ordered byline credits as `bylines[]` referencing those profiles. Credits are read straight from `_emdash_content_bylines` (whose `byline_id` already stores the translation group), so the exported seed round-trips back through `applySeed` with profiles and credits intact.

- [#1336](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1336) [`64d5675`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/64d56759250016fb4bfb2a2ab83106407ffd61a7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Pre-bundle EmDash's auth, MCP, and admin-shell dependencies so `astro dev` on Cloudflare no longer triggers a re-optimize + full-reload cascade on the first authenticated/admin/MCP request.

  These deps (`@oslojs/crypto/{hmac,subtle,rsa}`, `arctic`, the MCP server entrypoints, `@lingui/react`, `@cloudflare/kumo/primitives`, `astro/assets/services/noop`) are only imported on routes the initial Vite scan never reaches, so the workerd runtime discovered them one at a time. Each discovery invalidated the optimize cache mid-flight, producing `The file does not exist at ".../deps_ssr/chunk-*.js"` errors and repeated full reloads on cold start. Adding them to the Cloudflare SSR `optimizeDeps.include` list front-loads them into a single startup optimize pass.

- [#1331](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1331) [`77fff0a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/77fff0a36cd4d6dc242c1d8dd58934ca14cd6dbd) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fix `emdash export-seed` collapsing locale variants into duplicate seed ids on i18n projects. The CLI never initializes the runtime i18n config, so `isI18nEnabled()` was always `false` and the exporter stripped the `:locale` suffix from taxonomy, menu, and content seed ids — merging every locale variant into one bare id and producing duplicates that `validateSeed` rejected. The exporter now derives locale-awareness from the data (a project is multi-locale when its i18n-aware tables hold more than one distinct locale), so multi-locale exports keep their per-locale suffixes and `translationOf` links while genuinely single-locale projects still export bare ids.

- [#1340](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1340) [`87c40d3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/87c40d34b3a0130f67bf7d31caf40572f14135e6) Thanks [@emdashbot](https://github.com/apps/emdashbot)! - Fix `getEmDashCollection` pagination losing `nextCursor` with Astro 6 live collections. Astro's `getLiveCollection` repacks loader results and drops the `nextCursor` field before it reaches the caller. The wrapper now over-fetches by one entry whenever a `limit` is provided, slices the extra row locally, and synthesizes `nextCursor` via the existing `encodeEntryCursor` helper — matching the strategy already used by the bucketing path.

### Minor Changes

- [#1258](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1258) [`28432b9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/28432b9b5a045c9227d59f7762bf9cb37067a950) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Adds custom fields to bylines. Sites can define site-specific byline metadata (Twitter handle, pronouns, company, localised job title, etc.) via the new `/byline-schema` admin screen, accessed from the **Byline schema** link button at the top of the Bylines admin page (admin-only).

  Per-field `translatable` flag picks whether values are stored per-locale (one value per locale row in a `translation_group`) or shared across every locale variant of the same byline identity. Schema management is gated by `schema:manage`; value editing by `bylines:manage`.

  Custom-field values can be set at both create and update time. `POST` and `PUT` on `/_emdash/api/admin/bylines` accept the same `customFields` map; the row write and the custom-field writes share a single transaction on Node/PG so a partial failure rolls both back. On D1 (no transactions), a retry POST is treated as completing an abandoned create iff three checks all pass: (a) every fixed column on the existing row matches the new payload (`displayName`, `bio`, `avatarMediaId`, `websiteUrl`, `userId`, `isGuest`, effective locale — null-vs-undefined normalised); (b) the existing row's `translationGroup` matches what a fresh create with the same input would produce (`sourceGroup` when `translationOf` is present, `existing.id` when it isn't); (c) every custom-field value already stored on the row appears in the input payload with an equal value (subset-match, so partial mid-loop crashes can be completed). The recovery branch is conservative on every axis: any fixed-column mismatch, any translation-group mismatch, any overlapping custom-field value mismatch, an input that omits a key the existing row stores, or an input with no custom fields at all → standard `CONFLICT`. Validation runs before any DB write so a bad value (unknown slug, type mismatch, select-choice miss, non-URL or non-http(s) URL for a `url` field) returns 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` without leaving partial state behind. In the admin, registered fields render inline with Name, Bio, etc. — no separate section header — and are available in the **New byline** dialog as well as edit.

  `BylineSummary` gains an optional `customFields: Record<string, CustomFieldValue>` property. Existing object-literal consumers stay source-compatible because the property is optional and runtime always returns `{}` when no fields are registered.

  Hydration is symmetric with writes: rows are only applied to a byline when they live in the table matching the field's current `translatable` flag, so stale rows from a `translatable` flip can't leak into hydrated output. Schema mutations on `/byline-schema` invalidate the same `byline-fields` query the byline form reads, so newly-registered fields appear in the editor without a page reload. `url` field values are parsed with `new URL(...)` AND restricted to `http:` / `https:` schemes at write time so they can't ship `javascript:` / `data:` / `mailto:` payloads to link rendering. The `BylineFieldEditor` "Save" button stays disabled until a `select` field has at least one option; and select-option lists are accumulated on a null-prototype object so option values that collide with `Object.prototype` keys render correctly.

  The field-definitions cache uses parity on `options.byline_fields_version` as a dirty bit: schema mutations flip the counter to odd before the write lands and to a **new even** value after, with the cache treating any odd version as "bypass the global holder, read fresh from the DB". `markVersionDirty` is parity-aware (ensures odd, no-op if already odd) so a crashed prior attempt's leftover dirty state can't get inverted. `markVersionClean` is **always-advance** (`+2` when starting even, `+1` when starting odd) so two concurrent mutators can't collapse on the same even key and pin the cache on a partial-set snapshot — every committed mutation produces an observable counter change for cache readers. Idempotent-retry exits (`FIELD_EXISTS` on create, `FIELD_NOT_FOUND` on update/delete, no-op input on update) call `markVersionClean` too, which doubles as both the dirty-crash recovery and the false-clean recovery. All version writes use `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` so a missing options row can't silently turn invalidation into a no-op.

  Implements [#1174](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/discussions/1174). Builds on the bylines-i18n foundation from [#1146](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1146).

- [#1215](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1215) [`590b2f9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/590b2f97367d6881d8c59e5f0a88e7ad69138acb) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - First-class HTML block in the admin editor. The existing `htmlBlock` Portable Text type (produced by the WordPress and Contentful importers) is now a fully editable block in the rich-text editor. Authors can insert an HTML block via the `/html` slash command and edit raw HTML in a textarea. Imported `htmlBlock` content that previously fell through to an opaque `pluginBlock` placeholder is now rendered in the same editable UI. The inline (visual-editing) editor preserves HTML blocks as read-only placeholders to prevent data loss.

### Patch Changes

- [#1298](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1298) [`cd2dcc6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cd2dcc6a56d19f38d6e13ba55e8563ceaab90ef8) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Byline hydration now resolves the author avatar's storage key in the same query. `getEmDashCollection` / `getEmDashEntry` populate `entry.data.bylines[].byline.avatarStorageKey` (and `avatarAlt`) via a `LEFT JOIN` on the media table, so list pages can build a direct avatar URL without a per-byline `MediaRepository.findById`. Previously the byline summary exposed only `avatarMediaId` (a bare ULID with no file extension), forcing sites that want direct storage URLs into an N+1 media lookup. A page rendering 20 posts by distinct authors paid ~20 extra queries. The new fields are additive and null on the plain byline finders (`findById`, `findBySlug`), which do not join media; rely on the content-credit hydration path for them.

- [#1197](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1197) [`62c170f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/62c170f11403d76370d6c89f8fa25b0bbcf003fd) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Persist welcome-dismissed flag in database instead of session. Previously the welcome modal would be shown every time a user logged-in.

- [#1295](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1295) [`ee67273`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ee67273df089d7ed858542fb0df16650f80cbb15) Thanks [@emdashbot](https://github.com/apps/emdashbot)! - fix(core/redirects): match exact redirects regardless of trailing slash ([#1271](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1271))

  Exact redirect rules now match requests with or without a trailing slash. A redirect stored with source `/old/` will also match a request for `/old`, and a redirect stored with source `/old` will also match `/old/`. The stored source is preserved unchanged; the fallback happens at lookup time.

- [#1226](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1226) [`9422d6a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9422d6a744b17f477a3966c3c7e07a087a3345e6) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Make content list search work on large collections ([#1219](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1219)). The admin content list previously filtered only the rows already loaded on the current page, so an entry far back in a big collection could not be found until you navigated near it. The list endpoint now accepts a `q` parameter and performs a case-insensitive substring search across the collection's title/name/slug columns server-side (LIKE wildcards in the query are escaped), and the admin search box drives that query (debounced) instead of filtering in memory. Also adds locale-aware composite indexes (`idx_{table}_loc_upd` / `idx_{table}_loc_crt`) so locale-filtered content lists stay index-served on large, i18n-enabled tables.

- [#1302](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1302) [`1f8190d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1f8190d2dee2f93a0a64ddfbe4f481cb6892ce2b) Thanks [@WellDunDun](https://github.com/WellDunDun)! - Fixes locale-aware content updates so REST, CLI, client, and MCP callers can safely update content by slug when multiple locales share the same slug.

- [#1224](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1224) [`67f5992`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/67f5992aec23d02c724505632ce951e5b7af9cdb) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Fix taxonomy terms not being locale-aware in the content editor ([#1218](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1218)). Term assignments are stored against the per-locale content row while the term's `translation_group` spans every locale, so resolving terms for an entry must scope to the entry's locale. The content terms endpoint (`/content/:collection/:id/terms/:taxonomy`) now derives the entry's locale server-side and passes it to `getTermsForEntry`, and the admin `TaxonomySidebar` threads the entry locale through its fetch/save calls (and into its React Query keys, so switching translations refetches). Previously a localized post showed and applied every locale variant of a tag instead of just the variant for its own locale.

- [#1227](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1227) [`a40e455`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a40e455a8de730a61291798a3fe0ee32dde24ed0) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Add search and filtering to the media library ([#1221](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1221)). The media list endpoint now accepts a `q` parameter for a case-insensitive filename substring search (which also matches extensions, with LIKE wildcards escaped), alongside the existing `mimeType` filter. The Media Library page gains a filename search box and a type filter (images / video / audio / documents), and the media picker in the content editor now searches the local library by filename too. Previously neither surface could search or filter local media, which made large libraries hard to navigate.

- [#1319](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1319) [`69bdc97`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/69bdc97e3e4b69a111b3e5210900e23f35134f8d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix `require is not defined` crash on every EmDash API route under `astro dev` on Cloudflare Workers ([#1292](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1292)).

  `@emdash-cms/registry-client` listed `semver` (CommonJS) in `dependencies`, which the build externalizes -- so consumers loaded a nested CJS copy. Vite's SSR module runner (workerd) evaluates modules with no `require` binding, so semver's internal `require()` threw and took down any route whose import graph reached registry-client (schema, plugins, env compatibility checks). semver is now bundled into the ESM output, so nothing CommonJS reaches the worker.

- [#1285](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1285) [`5e7f835`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5e7f83571dbc4832e91881aafbb470407c19b482) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix SEO fields (noindex toggle, canonical URL) not affecting rendered pages. The content loader now surfaces per-entry SEO metadata on `entry.data.seo`, so `getSeoMeta()` reflects values set in the admin SEO panel. SEO is folded into the existing entry query via a LEFT JOIN, adding no extra database round-trips.

- [#1298](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1298) [`cd2dcc6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cd2dcc6a56d19f38d6e13ba55e8563ceaab90ef8) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Seed files can now attach an avatar to a byline. `bylines[].avatar` takes a `storageKey` (plus optional `alt`, `filename`, `mimeType`, `width`, `height`) for a file that already exists in the configured storage; applying the seed creates a `media` row and links it to the byline via `avatarMediaId`. Unlike a content `$media` reference, nothing is downloaded or uploaded, which suits seeding bylines alongside a media migration.

When Astro i18n is enabled, each translation row is emitted as its own `<url>` with the correct locale prefix (resolved via Astro's own `getRelativeLocaleUrl`, so `prefixDefaultLocale` and custom `path` mappings are honoured). Every entry also lists its sibling translations as `<xhtml:link rel="alternate" hreflang="...">` (plus `x-default` for the default-locale variant), grouped by `translation_group`. Sites with a single locale or no i18n configured are unaffected -- their sitemap XML is unchanged.

- [#1238](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1238) [`60c0b2e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/60c0b2eeab7726471b313d0c453de82df1e08558) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Registry plugins can now declare environment requirements. A plugin's manifest may set a release-level `requires` block (e.g. `{ "env:emdash": ">=1.0.0", "env:astro": ">=4.16" }`), which is published into the release record. When browsing a registry plugin, the admin compares those constraints against the running EmDash and Astro versions: if the host doesn't satisfy them, it shows a compatibility warning and disables the Install button. The server enforces the same check on install and update, refusing an incompatible release with `ENV_INCOMPATIBLE` so the gate can't be bypassed.

Declare them in `emdash-plugin.jsonc` under `release.artifacts` as file refs; `emdash-plugin publish --artifact-base-url <url>` measures each image's dimensions, uploads it, and records it in the release. The admin plugin detail page renders the icon, banner, and a screenshot gallery, fetched through a server-side image proxy. The proxy resolves each artifact's URL server-side from the validated release record (the client sends only the artifact's coordinates, never a URL), then applies SSRF defences and an image content-type allowlist before serving the bytes. Supported image types are PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, and AVIF; SVG is rejected at both publish and proxy because it is active content.

Previously, only taxonomy-based keys were processed via JOIN; non-taxonomy field names were silently discarded. Now the `where` clause supports exact match (`string`), multi-value match (`string[]`), and range comparisons (`{ gt?, gte?, lt?, lte? }`) on any content table column, all executed at the SQL layer with parameterized queries.

The outer run-grouping broke on the first nested type switch (e.g. an `orderedList` child under a `bulletList` parent), so an input like `[bullet L1, number L2, bullet L1]` was emitted as three separate top-level lists instead of one bullet list with a numbered sub-list under the first item. Internal `convertList`/`convertListItem` recursion was already correct — only the outer grouping needed to be widened to include `level > 1` blocks regardless of `listItem` type.

Moved `EmDashDatabaseError` into a new SQLite driver-free `database/errors.ts` and re-exported it from there, so the `better-sqlite3` import doesn't leak into the Postgres build.

The rewrite step passed the whole stored MediaValue JSON to the URL matcher instead of its inner `src`, so the field was never rewritten to the local R2 URL even though the file existed in the media table. Inline content images were unaffected.

### Minor Changes

- [#426](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/426) [`02ed8ba`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/02ed8ba32ef1f4301d84465b934430eee08eef74) Thanks [@BenjaminPrice](https://github.com/BenjaminPrice)! - Adds workerd-based plugin sandboxing for Node.js deployments.
  - **emdash**: Adds `isHealthy()` to `SandboxRunner` interface, `SandboxUnavailableError` class, `sandbox: false` config option, `mediaStorage` field on `SandboxOptions`, and exports `createHttpAccess`/`createUnrestrictedHttpAccess`/`PluginStorageRepository`/`UserRepository`/`OptionsRepository` for platform adapters.
  - **@emdash-cms/cloudflare**: Implements `isHealthy()` on `CloudflareSandboxRunner`. Fixes `storageQuery()` and `storageCount()` to honor `where`, `orderBy`, and `cursor` options (previously ignored, causing infinite pagination loops and incorrect filtered counts). Adds `storageConfig` to `PluginBridgeProps` so `PluginStorageRepository` can use declared indexes.
  - **@emdash-cms/sandbox-workerd**: New package. `WorkerdSandboxRunner` for production (workerd child process + capnp config + authenticated HTTP backing service) and `MiniflareDevRunner` for development.

- [#1146](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1146) [`11b3001`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/11b300100e066c6b3463070a9b65fba868f37e9b) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Adds first-class i18n support for bylines, mirroring the row-per-locale model already used by menus and taxonomies (PR #916, migrations 036).

  ## Schema (migration 040)

  `_emdash_bylines` gains two columns:
  - `locale` — `TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'en'`. Every row now belongs to exactly one locale.
  - `translation_group` — `TEXT NOT NULL`. Shared across every locale variant of a single byline identity. The anchor row's `translation_group` equals its `id`; siblings inherit it.

  A partial unique index `idx_bylines_group_locale_unique` enforces one row per `(translation_group, locale)`. The pre-existing `(slug)` unique index becomes `(slug, locale)` to allow the same slug across locales.

  Existing rows are backfilled to the configured `defaultLocale` (or `'en'` if i18n isn't configured) with `translation_group = id`. Monolingual sites see no functional change; multilingual sites continue rendering the same byline data at the default locale until editors create translations.

  ## Credit hydration: strict per-locale

  `_emdash_content_bylines.byline_id` now stores the byline's `translation_group`, not its row id. When an entry is rendered, credits are filtered by joining the junction against the byline sibling whose `locale` matches the entry's `locale`. If no sibling exists at the entry's locale, the credit hydrates as empty — there is **no fallback** to other locales' bios.

  Author-inferred bylines (where an entry has no explicit credits but its author is linked to a byline) still fall back per-locale and respect the strictness gate: an entry with explicit credits at any locale will not infer from the author even if the explicit credits don't resolve at the rendering locale.

  This is a deliberate behavior change for multilingual sites. The motivation is correctness: chain-walking credits across locales renders the wrong-language bio on translated entries.

  The "explicit credit suppresses author fallback" check reads `primary_byline_id` directly from the content row — set by `setContentBylines` iff junction rows exist, backfilled by migration 040 for pre-existing rows. No separate probe against `_emdash_content_bylines` is needed at hydration time; the column is folded into the single per-entry context fetch (`author_id` + `primary_byline_id` in one query). Both monolingual and multilingual sites get the same query count.

  ## Identity lookups: chain-walk

  `getBylineBySlug(slug, { locale })` walks the configured fallback chain (`resolveLocaleChain`), like `getMenu` and `getTerm`. Author pages for un-translated bylines still render an identity rather than 404'ing. This is conceptually distinct from credit hydration and runs through `requestCached` for per-render dedupe.

  ## Admin
  - **TranslationsPanel** in the bylines editor lists every configured locale with Edit / Translate buttons. The Translate action POSTs to the new `POST /_emdash/api/admin/bylines/:id/translations` endpoint.
  - **LocaleSwitcher** on `/bylines` filters the list strictly to one locale. Cross-locale navigation via TranslationsPanel routes through `/bylines?locale=…`.
  - The **byline picker** on the content editor is locale-pinned to the entry's locale. Editors only see bylines that will actually hydrate at the entry's locale.
  - The **byline credit empty state** on a locale with no bylines yet shows a CTA linking to `/bylines?locale=…` for inline creation.
  - Translating an entry (`POST /content/:collection` with `translationOf`) calls `copyContentBylines` to inherit the source's credits — these resolve at the new entry's locale via the strict-hydration model, so credits "follow" the content across translations once sibling bylines exist.

  ## API additions
  - `GET /_emdash/api/admin/bylines/:id/translations` — list every sibling row sharing a translation_group.
  - `POST /_emdash/api/admin/bylines/:id/translations` — create a sibling at a target locale. Body defaults (slug, displayName, websiteUrl, avatar) inherit from the source.
  - `POST /_emdash/api/admin/bylines` accepts `translationOf` + `locale` to create a sibling in one call.
  - `GET /_emdash/api/admin/bylines?locale=…` filters strictly.
  - `BylineSummary` gains `locale: string` and `translationGroup: string | null` (additive — existing consumers ignore the new fields).

  ## Permissions

  Two new entries on `@emdash-cms/auth`:
  - `bylines:read` — minimum `SUBSCRIBER`.
  - `bylines:manage` — minimum `EDITOR`.

  All byline routes (list, get, update, delete, translations) now check these instead of `content:read` / `Role.EDITOR`. Role thresholds are unchanged, so existing users see no permission differences. Custom RBAC configurations that bind to the old strings should add the new permission names.

  ## Repository
  - `BylineRepository` is strict per-locale: `findMany`, `findBySlug`, `findById` accept an optional `locale` and return rows matching that locale (or all locales when omitted, for the manager view).
  - New methods: `listTranslations(id)`, `findByTranslationGroup(group)`, `copyContentBylines(collection, fromId, toId)`.
  - `setContentBylines` deduplicates by `translation_group` after resolving wire row ids, so passing two sibling row ids of the same identity collapses to one credit row.
  - `delete` is sibling-aware: removing one locale variant leaves siblings standing.

  ## Notable trade-offs
  - **Strict hydration over chain-walking** for credits. Chain-walking would render mismatched-language bios on translated content. The honest answer is to show nothing rather than the wrong thing; the picker tells editors which bylines will resolve at the entry's locale, and the empty-state CTA makes creating a sibling a one-click flow.
  - **Schema is row-per-locale**, not a separate `byline_translations` side-table. Matches the existing content / menu / taxonomy convention so query patterns and indexes are consistent across the codebase.

- [#1176](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1176) [`fae97ee`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fae97ee5465934365864557e9fa3ee8754cfd49c) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Code blocks in the rich text editor now have an inline language picker. Hover over any code block to reveal a chip in the corner; click it to enter a language (free-form input with curated suggestions for ~30 common languages including TypeScript, Python, Bash, Rust, Astro, SQL, and more). Aliases resolve automatically -- typing `ts` stores `typescript`, `c++` stores `cpp`, etc. The existing markdown shortcut (typing ` ```html ` followed by a space or Enter) continues to pre-populate the language. The chosen language persists on the Portable Text `language` field and is emitted as a `language-{id}` class on the rendered `<pre>` so frontend syntax highlighters can pick it up. The visual (in-place) editor gets the same picker UI.

The "uninstall is not yet available for registry plugins" placeholder is gone — registry plugin rows now show the same Uninstall and Update buttons.

  The Plugins page's "updates available" indicator now covers registry plugins too. If the registry aggregator is unreachable, marketplace updates still load (and vice versa).

  Updates that need newly-declared permissions, or that newly expose a public (unauthenticated) route, prompt for re-consent before installing the new version — matching the gate that marketplace updates already have.

- [#1125](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1125) [`d0ff94b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d0ff94bd476e7fd4b5d18c94904cfb5c071fea92) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds a version picker to the registry plugin detail page. Older releases of a registry-hosted plugin are now selectable from a dropdown next to the Install button, and the displayed version, indexed date, permissions, and source link swap to match the selected release. Pre-release versions (e.g. `1.0.0-alpha.1`) are flagged with a "Pre-release" badge so admins can spot them before installing. Versions still inside the configured minimum-release-age holdback remain visible in the dropdown but stay non-installable until they age into the window.

Two layers run:
  - **Response envelope** (`uri`, `cid`, `did`, `slug`, `version`, …): `DiscoveryClient` now routes every call through `@atcute/client`'s schema-validating `.call()` against the aggregator method's output lexicon. Request params are validated too. A non-conforming envelope throws `ClientValidationError`.
  - **Embedded signed `profile` / `release` records** (typed `unknown` by the aggregator lexicon because they are relayed verbatim from publisher repos under a different lexicon namespace): now `safeParse`'d against `com.emdashcms.experimental.package.profile` / `release`. A conforming record is returned as the typed lexicon shape; a non-conforming one is surfaced as `null` so one bad record doesn't fail an entire search page.

  Refines the return types from `unknown` to `PackageProfile.Main | null` / `PackageRelease.Main | null` (new exported `ValidatedPackageView` / `ValidatedReleaseView` / `ValidatedSearchPackages` / `ValidatedListReleases` types). Callers must null-check. The registry install handler now fails closed when the aggregator returns a release record that does not conform to its lexicon.

  Validation is structural only — the lexicon's `uri` format permits non-HTTP schemes, so UI rendering these URLs still applies its own scheme allow-list.

### Minor Changes

- [#1057](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1057) [`c0ce915`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c0ce915c555b8658245d465255e2ec89b361c57f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - **BREAKING (plugin authors):** Reworks how sandboxed plugins are defined. The `definePlugin()` helper is removed for sandboxed-format plugins; the new shape is a bare default export with a `satisfies SandboxedPlugin` annotation. A new type-only subpath `emdash/plugin` provides the types.

  This affects anyone _writing_ a sandboxed plugin. Sites that _use_ plugins are unaffected (see the per-plugin changesets for the import-shape change in published plugins).

  ```diff
  - import { definePlugin, type ContentHookEvent, type PluginContext } from "emdash";
  + import type { SandboxedPlugin } from "emdash/plugin";

  - export default definePlugin({
  + export default {
       hooks: {
           "content:beforeSave": {
  -			handler: async (event: ContentHookEvent, ctx: PluginContext) => {
  +			handler: async (event, ctx) => {
                   // ...
                   return event.content;
               },
           },
       },
  - });
  + } satisfies SandboxedPlugin;
  ```

  Three changes:
  1. **Drop `import { definePlugin } from "emdash"`** and the `definePlugin(...)` wrapping call. Sandboxed plugins now default-export the bare object.
  2. **`import type { SandboxedPlugin } from "emdash/plugin"`** and add `satisfies SandboxedPlugin` to the default export. The `emdash/plugin` subpath is type-only — the bundler erases the import, so no runtime resolution of `emdash` is needed (and the heavy `emdash` runtime no longer enters the plugin bundle).
  3. **Drop handler parameter annotations** like `event: ContentSaveEvent, ctx: PluginContext`. The strict mapped type on `SandboxedPlugin` infers them per hook name, with the full canonical event type. If you need to reference an event type by name (e.g. in a helper function), `emdash/plugin` re-exports them: `import type { ContentHookEvent, PluginContext } from "emdash/plugin"`.

  **Why:** the old `definePlugin` was an identity function whose only job was to alias `emdash` to a Proxy shim at build time so the import would resolve. With the new shape, sandboxed plugins have _no_ runtime `emdash` import — only type-only imports from `emdash/plugin`. The bundler doesn't need to alias anything; the build pipeline is simpler; and authors get strict per-hook event/return type inference for free.

  The trade-off: previously you could narrow an event type locally (e.g. `interface ContentSaveEvent { content: ... & { id: string } }`). Under the strict mapped type, the canonical event type wins (TypeScript's contravariance on function parameters means narrowing isn't assignable). Authors validate fields at runtime with `typeof` / `isRecord` checks instead — which is the right pattern for input that comes from outside the type system anyway.

  **Routes** follow the same simplification. The two-arg `(routeCtx, ctx)` shape is unchanged; only the annotations disappear:

  ```ts
  export default {
  	routes: {
  		health: async (routeCtx, ctx) => {
  			// routeCtx: SandboxedRouteContext, ctx: PluginContext — both inferred.
  			return new Response("ok");
  		},
  	},
  } satisfies SandboxedPlugin;
  ```

  `SandboxedRouteContext` exposes `{ input, request, requestMeta? }`. `request` is typed as `SandboxedRequest` — a `{ url, method, headers }` record that's portable across in-process and isolate execution (Worker Loader can't pass real `Request` objects across the boundary).

  **Native plugins are unaffected.** This change applies only to sandboxed-format plugins. Native plugins continue to use `definePlugin()` from `emdash` and the existing `PluginDefinition` shape.

  **Type rename:** `SandboxedPlugin` on the `emdash` package now refers to the new author-facing source-shape type. The runtime-side handle type (returned by `SandboxRunner.load`, held in the runtime's plugin cache) is renamed to `SandboxedPluginInstance`. If you import `SandboxedPlugin` from `emdash` to type a sandbox runner implementation or hold runtime plugin handles, update those imports to `SandboxedPluginInstance`. Public consumers of this type are mostly limited to `@emdash-cms/cloudflare` and other sandbox runner adapters; standard plugin / site code is unaffected.

  **Removed types:** `StandardPluginDefinition`, `StandardHookHandler`, `StandardHookEntry`, `StandardRouteHandler`, `StandardRouteEntry` are no longer exported from `emdash`. These were authoring-helper aliases under the old permissive `definePlugin` standard overload. Use `SandboxedPlugin` from `emdash/plugin` for the same purpose under the new shape.

  **Removed function:** `isStandardPluginDefinition` is gone. There's no equivalent — sandboxed plugins are identified by structure (`{ hooks?, routes? }`) and you should treat the default export as already typed via `satisfies SandboxedPlugin`.

- [#1052](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1052) [`0d5843f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0d5843fc3378936667ab81c56001349198028ebb) Thanks [@Rimander](https://github.com/Rimander)! - Fixes menu REST API consistency:
  - **`POST /menus/:name/items` no longer accepts unknown keys silently.** Sending `custom_url` (snake_case) or `url` used to return 201 with `custom_url: null` because Zod's default `.strip()` quietly dropped them. The schemas now use `.strict()` and return **400 `VALIDATION_ERROR`** with `Unrecognized key: "custom_url"`. The documented camelCase keys (`customUrl`, `sortOrder`, `referenceCollection`, etc.) are unchanged and persist as before. The `type` field is now validated against the canonical enum (`"custom" | "page" | "post" | "taxonomy" | "collection"`); previously any string passed.
  - **Moves per-item writes to `PUT` and `DELETE /menus/:name/items/:id` (path-style).** Every other EmDash resource (`content`, `taxonomies`, `redirects`, `sections`, `widget-areas`) addresses items by URL path; menus were the lone outlier requiring `?id=<id>` in the query string. The legacy query-string form is **removed** (it was undocumented and only used by the admin, which is updated in this PR). Callers should use `PUT /menus/:name/items/:id` / `DELETE /menus/:name/items/:id`.
  - **Menu and menu-item API responses are now camelCase**, aligning with the rest of EmDash's REST surface (`content`, `taxonomies`, `redirects`, …). `created_at` → `createdAt`, `updated_at` → `updatedAt`, `menu_id` → `menuId`, `parent_id` → `parentId`, `sort_order` → `sortOrder`, `reference_collection` → `referenceCollection`, `reference_id` → `referenceId`, `custom_url` → `customUrl`, `title_attr` → `titleAttr`, `css_classes` → `cssClasses`, `translation_group` → `translationGroup`. **Breaking** for direct REST consumers that depend on snake_case keys in the response body. The admin UI is already updated.
  - **Refactors menus to the standard repository pattern.** Adds `MenuRepository` next to `ContentRepository`, `TaxonomyRepository`, `RedirectRepository`, `MediaRepository`, `CommentRepository`. Handlers become thin orchestrators; the repository is now the single place where snake_case rows become camelCase entities.

  These changes do not touch any database schema or migration. Existing data is preserved.

- [#1011](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1011) [`dbaea9c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/dbaea9ccaef6ac48dda14b77c6b2adbe0dc0ff38) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds experimental support for the decentralized plugin registry (see RFC #694). Configure with `experimental.registry.aggregatorUrl` in `astro.config.mjs`; the admin UI then uses the registry instead of the centralized marketplace for browse and install. Marketplace behavior is unchanged when the option is not set.

  The experimental config accepts a `policy.minimumReleaseAge` duration (e.g. `"48h"`) that holds back releases below that age from install and update prompts, with a `policy.minimumReleaseAgeExclude` allowlist for trusted publishers or specific packages. The minimum-release-age check is enforced both client-side (for UX) and server-side (in the install endpoint), so stale browser tabs and deep links still hit the gate.

### Patch Changes

- [#1076](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1076) [`6e62b90`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6e62b90e14615a2012a5885849e6b1d1062e7c0b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes spurious TypeScript errors in strict projects that consume EmDash. Several subpaths (`emdash/routes/*`, `emdash/api/route-utils`, `emdash/api/schemas`, `emdash/auth/providers/github`, `emdash/auth/providers/google`) previously shipped raw source, so your `tsc` and editor type-checked EmDash's internals against your config and could report errors that weren't yours. These now ship compiled type declarations instead. The `*-admin` providers and `emdash/ui` stay source because they bridge the admin React/Astro runtime your own build processes. Import paths and runtime behaviour are unchanged.

- [#1086](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1086) [`23597d0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/23597d017360673cf95eee8e5d24c873137fc215) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes silent data loss in migration 036 on Cloudflare D1 (#1021). D1 ignores `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF` and its replacement `defer_foreign_keys` only defers constraint validation, it doesn't suppress CASCADE actions, so dropping any table during the i18n rebuild fired its child cascades. Three FK relationships were affected:
  - `content_taxonomies.taxonomy_id -> taxonomies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` wiped all post-taxonomy associations.
  - `taxonomies.parent_id -> taxonomies(id) ON DELETE SET NULL` flattened taxonomy hierarchies.
  - `_emdash_menu_items.menu_id -> _emdash_menus(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` wiped every menu item on the install (along with `parent_id -> _emdash_menu_items(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` mopping up nested items).

  The migration now physically removes those FK relationships before any drop. `content_taxonomies` and `_emdash_menu_items` are rebuilt without their parent FKs as the first steps of up(), and the new `taxonomies` self-FK targets its temporary name (`taxonomies_new`) which SQLite rebinds on RENAME. The FKs from migration 005 on `_emdash_menu_items` are not restored on rollback either: the runtime always deleted child rows explicitly, so the cascade was redundant and reinstating it would only re-create the #1021 hazard on any future migration that drops `_emdash_menus`. Rollback also refuses to run when `content_taxonomies` has rows referencing translation groups with no surviving `taxonomies` row, surfacing dangling data before any destructive work, and the `idx_content_taxonomies_term` index from migration 015 is restored after each rebuild.

  This is forward-fix only. Installs that already lost data when running 036 will need to restore from D1 Time Travel.

- [#1088](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1088) [`883b75b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/883b75b992854a4e339d3896bbd73bec36180b9b) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Fixes `EmDashClient.terms()` returning `{ terms }` instead of `{ items }`, which caused `page.items` to be `undefined` for any caller that iterated the result. The API handler returns `{ terms: TermWithCount[] }` but the client was typed and advertised as `ListResult<Term>` — the key name mismatch is now mapped correctly.

- [#751](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/751) [`05440b1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/05440b11ef5df609ad7f800143fa96019da22101) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fix the admin collection list pagination denominator so it no longer grows in increments of 5 as the user pages forward.

  The `GET /_emdash/api/content/{collection}` response now includes a `total` field with the full filtered row count (independent of `limit`). The admin uses it as the pagination denominator, so a 143-entry collection reads `1/8` on page 1 instead of `1/5 → 5/10 → 10/15 → …` as successive API pages load.

  The `total` field is optional; pre-upgrade clients that ignore it still work, and the admin falls back to the loaded-item count when an older server doesn't return it.

  Also handles the edge case where the current page exceeds `totalPages` after filtering or deletion — the admin clamps the active page so the table doesn't render empty while waiting for a refetch.

- [#1000](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1000) [`94fb50b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/94fb50b0338d21037a6623de7f350a1621b1b811) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes invite passkey registration behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy. The invite `register-options` endpoint now resolves the public origin via `getPublicOrigin(url, emdash.config)` before calling `getPasskeyConfig`, matching every other passkey endpoint. Previously the WebAuthn RP ID fell back to `url.hostname` (e.g. `localhost`), causing the browser to reject the registration with "Security error" when the public origin differed from the upstream host.

- [#1013](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1013) [`0cd8c6d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0cd8c6d4e0f0dc126d66f953afcfdc3d6201d00b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the slash command menu's initial selection getting overridden when the menu opens under a stationary pointer. The menu items previously reacted to `mouseenter` unconditionally, so an item rendered beneath the cursor would steal selection from the keyboard default before any user interaction. Mouse-hover-selects still works, but only after the user actually moves the pointer over the menu.

- [#1087](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1087) [`878a0b6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/878a0b689b9475e501f809d81d0fe494a040bfe4) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes two data-loss bugs in the WordPress WXR import path (admin UI Settings, Import, WordPress, i.e. `POST /_emdash/api/import/wordpress/execute`).

  Per-post taxonomy assignments parsed from `<wp:category>`, `<wp:tag>`, `<wp:term>`, and per-item `<category domain="...">` blocks (#1061) are now persisted. The HTTP execute handler previously extracted this data and silently discarded it before any taxonomy or pivot rows were written. Terms are created idempotently in EmDash's seeded `category` and `tag` taxonomies; custom taxonomies such as `genre` are matched against existing EmDash definitions via the runtime's locale fallback chain (`resolveLocaleChain`), so imports against a non-default-locale site reuse defs seeded at the default locale instead of false-failing. Unknown custom taxonomies surface in a new `result.taxonomies.missingTaxonomies` field instead of being silently dropped, so the admin can prompt the user to create the missing definition. Assignments respect each taxonomy definition's `collections` array.

  WPML and Polylang translations (#1080) are now imported under their own per-post locale and linked via `translation_group`. Previously the entire upload shared one `config.locale` and the second post of any translation pair was rejected by the `UNIQUE(slug, locale)` constraint introduced in migration 019. The parser promotes per-post locale from `_icl_lang_code` (WPML), `trid` (WPML's translation group id), `_locale` (Polylang), the `language` taxonomy, or `_translations` postmeta. Terms are mirrored into each translation's locale so per-locale lookups (`getTermsForEntry(..., locale)`) resolve correctly on every translation row. Per-translation taxonomy assignments override anchor-inherited ones per-taxonomy when the translator picked different terms, matching WPML "Translate Independently" mode. Taxonomies the translation did not touch keep their inherited assignments, matching WPML "Sync" mode and Polylang's default.

  Adds `result.taxonomies` to the import response (additive). Existing consumers continue to work unchanged.

  Scope note: this fixes the HTTP import path, which is what the admin UI calls. The standalone `emdash import wordpress` CLI command writes JSON files to disk and has its own slug-only output path that does not carry locale, so it can still clobber two translations with the same `post_name`. That is a separate fix and not addressed here.

- [#768](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/768) [`121f173`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/121f1735f06520468d1532efd9f9fba88ff5d295) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes `SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB` (`database disk image is malformed`) when editing or publishing content on collections that have search enabled, and on restore-from-trash, permanent-delete, and edit-while-trashed flows.

  The FTS5 sync triggers used the contentless-table form (`DELETE FROM fts WHERE rowid = OLD.rowid`) on what is actually an external-content FTS5 table. After an UPDATE on `ec_<collection>`, FTS5 then read NEW column values from the (already updated) content table while trying to remove OLD tokens from the inverted index, drifting the index out of sync until SQLite refused further reads. Rewrites the triggers to use the documented external-content-safe `INSERT INTO fts(fts, rowid, ...) VALUES('delete', OLD.rowid, OLD.col1, ...)` pattern, gated on `OLD.deleted_at IS NULL` so we don't try to remove rows that were never indexed (which would itself raise `SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB` on restore-from-trash and permanent-delete).

  Adds migration `039_fix_fts5_triggers` that rebuilds the FTS index for every search-enabled collection on upgrade, replacing the broken triggers and recovering from any latent index corruption left behind by earlier mutations. The migration runs once at startup before the first request can hit the affected paths, so upgrading sites get the fix on their next deploy without depending on a search-endpoint visit to trigger lazy auto-repair.

- [#1077](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1077) [`f4a9711`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f4a9711d7e715b6f71129bf60665113052a52d60) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes `Astro.locals.emdash` typing. The shipped type declaration referenced a build artifact that does not exist, so `locals.emdash` silently fell back to `any` in every EmDash site — losing autocomplete and type-checking on the handlers API in your pages and endpoints. It is now correctly typed as `EmDashHandlers`.

- [#1019](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1019) [`5681eb2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5681eb2e43fbe57c535e5f828c1c8eba06b3eb89) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes a Zod type-incompatibility between trusted plugins and core. Without a workspace-level pin, emdash's `zod: ^4.3.5` could resolve to a different patch than Astro's bundled Zod, and Zod 4 embeds the version in the type — so schemas imported via `astro/zod` in trusted plugins (e.g. `@emdash-cms/plugin-forms`) were not assignable to `definePlugin`'s `PluginRoute<TInput>['input']`. Pins Zod in the pnpm catalog so the entire workspace dedupes on one instance.

- [#1074](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1074) [`ed917d9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ed917d9d534751241dafb9126fd0beddbd5ed593) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes stored config sharing when the runtime module is loaded as both compiled `dist` and raw `src` in the same process (Vite SSR / dual-package). The integration config is now keyed on a global `Symbol.for` registry entry instead of a typed `globalThis` var, matching the existing isolate-singleton pattern, so `getStoredConfig()` resolves consistently across both module copies.

- [#1076](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1076) [`6e62b90`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6e62b90e14615a2012a5885849e6b1d1062e7c0b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes a type error in the shipped WordPress-plugin import source: the analyze-endpoint error body from `response.json()` is `unknown` under `@cloudflare/workers-types` and was read without narrowing. This file ships as raw source via the `emdash/routes/*` export, so the error surfaced in strict consumer typechecks (issue #1053). The body is now typed before `.message` is read; runtime behaviour is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- [#997](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/997) [`7b45cba`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7b45cba66143c3a75bbd880abff85303c1fd6072) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds support for a site-wide default Open Graph image. The setting is exposed in the admin SEO settings page (Settings -> SEO -> Default Social Image), resolved to a URL on read by `getSiteSettings()`, and automatically emitted as `og:image` / `twitter:image` (and BlogPosting JSON-LD `image`) by `EmDashHead.astro` whenever a page has no image of its own. Per-page images still take precedence.

  This wires up an existing data model that was previously defined in the schema and MCP tools but never used: stored values were not resolved and no template path read the setting.

  Emitted URLs are absolutized using `SiteSettings.url`, the page's `siteUrl`, or the request origin so crawlers and JSON-LD consumers that reject relative URLs work correctly.

  Also adds a `localOnly` prop to `MediaPickerModal` that suppresses the "Insert from URL" input and external provider tabs. Used by SEO settings to ensure the picker only returns locally-stored media (since the setting only persists a local `mediaId`).

  Media metadata updates and deletes now invalidate the worker-scoped site-settings cache, so resolved logo/favicon/default-social-image URLs and dimensions stay in sync with the underlying media row.

### Patch Changes

The state ref was synced via `useEffect` (post-commit), so TipTap's Suggestion plugin could read stale state when invoking `onKeyDown` synchronously -- causing Enter to occasionally fail to execute commands and arrow navigation to skip selections on slower runs.

### Minor Changes

- [#978](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/978) [`27e6d58`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/27e6d58ec1ba547ece4736ac0a87309812a95681) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Enforces the sandboxed plugin bundle size caps from RFC 0001 §"Bundle size limits" in both the `bundle` and `publish` CLI flows: total decompressed ≤ 256 KB, per-file decompressed ≤ 128 KB, and at most 20 files per bundle. The previous bundle command capped only the total at 5 MB; the publish command now also re-validates the decompressed tarball before signing the release record so a publisher hits the same cap locally that aggregators enforce at ingest. Bundles between 256 KB and the old 5 MB ceiling will now be rejected — usually a sign the plugin is bundling host-provided dependencies or assets that belong in a CDN rather than the plugin payload.

- [#942](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/942) [`7c536e5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7c536e59b005a79925dd0ecab46404d9d34196b8) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Adds per-field allowed MIME types for `file` and `image` fields. Field-level `allowedTypes` is now honored end-to-end: it filters the media picker, widens upload acceptance for that field (so e.g. a zip-only field can accept zip uploads even though the global allowlist excludes them), and validates referenced media against the destination field on content save. The schema editor in admin gains an "Allowed types" control with curated presets and freeform entry.

  Behavior change: the `image` builder's `allowedTypes` option was previously accepted but read by nothing. It is now load-bearing — a code-first schema that already passed `allowedTypes` (e.g. `["image/png"]`) will now actually narrow the picker and gate uploads. Most users will see no change; if you set this option intending the old (silent) behavior, drop it.

  Behavior change: updating a field via the admin schema editor now explicitly clears its validation when the form contains no validation settings, instead of leaving an existing `validation` value intact. This only affects fields with pre-existing validation that is not expressible in the editor UI.

### Patch Changes

- [#893](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/893) [`f8ee1ed`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f8ee1ed5e7b02b8905ebec82fb703e3061fe8161) Thanks [@j-liszt](https://github.com/j-liszt)! - Enhances Passkey authentication with polymorphic algorithm support. Adds support for RS256 (RSA) alongside the existing ES256 (ECDSA) implementation, ensuring full compatibility with Windows Hello, hardware security keys, and FIDO2 standards. Includes a database migration to track and persist credential algorithms for future-proof authentication.

  Note for standalone `@emdash-cms/auth` consumers: If your `credentials` table already exists, you must manually run `ALTER TABLE credentials ADD COLUMN algorithm INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT -7` to support this update. The `DEFAULT -7` value ensures that existing rows (which are all ES256) continue to work seamlessly without requiring any data backfill.

- [#976](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/976) [`4c11017`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4c11017b833e4c009562b6063fd1fe281639f168) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes migration `016_api_tokens` failing with `table "_emdash_api_tokens" already exists` after a partially-applied previous attempt. If `up()` crashed mid-way (D1 subrequest limit, isolate cancellation, transient connection error), the migration record never got recorded and Kysely re-ran the migration from the top on the next request, blocking every subsequent boot. `up()` now uses `IF NOT EXISTS` on every CREATE so a retry skips already-applied steps and finishes the remainder. Resolves the "table already exists" error reported on fresh Cloudflare Workers + D1 deploys.

- [#939](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/939) [`f1d4c0b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f1d4c0bfc475ef947f0f4f00d171ab226f89dc6c) Thanks [@schiste](https://github.com/schiste)! - Make the MCP menu write tools locale-aware by exposing `locale` on `menu_create`,
  `menu_update`, `menu_delete`, and `menu_set_items`, exposing `translationOf` on
  `menu_create`, and teaching `handleMenuSetItems()` to target the requested locale
  and tag inserted menu items with that menu's locale.

  All seven menu-name lookups (`handleMenuUpdate`, `handleMenuDelete`,
  `handleMenuSetItems`, `handleMenuItemCreate`, `handleMenuItemUpdate`,
  `handleMenuItemDelete`, `handleMenuItemReorder`) now fail loud with the new
  `AMBIGUOUS_LOCALE` error code (HTTP 400) when called with a `name` that exists
  in multiple locales and no `locale` is provided. Previously the lookup silently
  picked an arbitrary translation, which could rewrite or delete the wrong
  locale's menu on multi-locale installs. The error message lists the available
  locales so callers can recover. Single-locale installs and callers that already
  pass `locale` are unaffected.

  The `translationOf` → `locale` requirement is now enforced inside
  `handleMenuCreate` (returns `VALIDATION_ERROR`), so REST/SDK callers get the
  same guard the MCP boundary already provided.

- [`d273e9a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d273e9a3d3dff6e356bc17dd3e22d294e9635b03) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Refactors the plugin manifest types to re-export from `@emdash-cms/plugin-types`. The capability vocabulary (`PluginCapability`, `CAPABILITY_RENAMES`, `normalizeCapability`, `isDeprecatedCapability`) and manifest shape (`ManifestHookEntry`, `ManifestRouteEntry`, `PluginStorageConfig`, `StorageCollectionConfig`) now live in the shared package so the registry CLI can write the same types core reads. Existing imports from `emdash`'s plugin types module continue to work unchanged.

The export emits stable seed IDs and `translationOf` references; the apply resolves them to the anchor's `translation_group`, matching the existing pattern for content entries, taxonomies, and terms.

Each request now emits `db.total` (cumulative DB ms), `db.count` (query count), `db.first` / `db.last` (first/last query offset from request start), and `cache.hit` / `cache.miss` (request-scoped cache stats). The Kysely log hook is now always installed so counters work without setting `EMDASH_QUERY_LOG`.

### Minor Changes

- [#916](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/916) [`71f4e7d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/71f4e7d85b2568dbadd9dc6ff26160789cb24e47) Thanks [@Rimander](https://github.com/Rimander)! - Adds i18n support to menus and taxonomies (categories, tags, custom
  definitions), mirroring the per-locale model already in place for content.
  Each row carries `locale` and `translation_group`; translations of the
  same menu/term/def share a `translation_group`. `_emdash_menu_items.reference_id`
  and `content_taxonomies.taxonomy_id` are remapped to store the referenced
  row's translation_group, so a single association survives content
  translations and is resolved against the active locale at runtime.
  - Runtime helpers (`getMenu`, `getTaxonomyTerms`, `getTerm`, `getEntryTerms`,
    `getAllTermsForEntries`, …) accept an optional `{ locale }` and honour the
    i18n fallback chain; when no locale is given they fall back to the
    request context and `defaultLocale`, matching `getEmDashCollection` /
    `getEmDashEntry`.
  - REST API: GET endpoints accept `?locale=xx`; POST endpoints accept
    `locale` and `translationOf` in their bodies. New endpoints:
    `GET/POST /_emdash/api/menus/:name/translations` and
    `GET/POST /_emdash/api/taxonomies/:name/terms/:slug/translations`.
  - Creating a content translation now auto-copies the source's taxonomy
    assignments (the pivot is locale-agnostic, so the copied rows apply to
    the whole translation group).
  - MCP: `taxonomy_list`, `taxonomy_list_terms`, `taxonomy_create_term`,
    `menu_list`, `menu_get` accept `locale`. New tools:
    `taxonomy_term_translations`, `menu_translations`.
  - Admin: `TaxonomyManager` and `MenuList` surface a `LocaleSwitcher` when
    multiple locales are configured and thread the active locale through
    all API calls. `TaxonomyManager` exposes a "Translate" action per term
    that creates the translation and switches to the new locale.

  No breaking changes for new installs or single-locale upgrades — defaults
  are additive (locale defaults to `'en'` when omitted, reproducing pre-i18n
  behaviour).

  > ⚠️ **Rolling back migration `036_i18n_menus_and_taxonomies` is blocked
  > on multi-locale installs.** Dropping the `locale` column would collapse
  > translated rows onto an ambiguous `(name, slug)` unique key, silently
  > deleting content. The migration's `down()` now refuses to run when any
  > row uses a non-default locale and prints the affected table in the
  > error. If you need to revert, export translations first (or delete
  > them), then re-run the rollback. Single-locale installs revert cleanly.

- [#902](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/902) [`7e32092`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7e32092596149ae2886bae34c8d2f4bad86dbe2f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - `emdash plugin init` now prompts for the plugin format (sandboxed or native) when run interactively, and the scaffolded boilerplate matches the canonical patterns from the docs. Both formats now ship a `dist/` build via tsdown, declare a sample `storage` collection, and demonstrate a hook plus an API route. The sandboxed entry uses an explicitly typed `ContentSaveEvent`; the native entry forwards options through `createPlugin`. The descriptor `id` is now derived from the slug instead of the full scoped package name, so scoped names like `@org/my-plugin` produce a runtime-valid id. Pass `--format=sandboxed`, `--format=native`, or `--native` to skip the prompt; non-TTY runs continue to default to sandboxed.

- [#896](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/896) [`699e1b3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/699e1b3d208a5ef4bca5dc3a40a39291e484f060) Thanks [@cristianuibar](https://github.com/cristianuibar)! - Fixes 500 error on `GET /_emdash/api/dashboard` when running on Cloudflare D1 with many title-bearing collections. `fetchRecentItems` now issues one query per collection in parallel and merges results in JS instead of building a single chained `UNION ALL`, which trips D1's `SQLITE_LIMIT_COMPOUND_SELECT` cap once enough collections are present (#895).

- [#719](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/719) [`2e2b8e9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2e2b8e90c099f3422808f0e1da9c83a9ec533b64) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the `file` field type rendering as a plain text input in the content editor. Adds a `FileFieldRenderer` that opens the media picker (with mime filter disabled) so any file type can be attached. Also adds a `hideUrlInput` prop to `MediaPickerModal` so non-image pickers can hide the image-specific "Insert from URL" input.

  Aligns the Zod schema and generated TypeScript types for `image` and `file` fields with the shape the admin actually stores: `provider?`, `meta?` (for both), and `previewUrl?` (for image). Previously these fields were stripped on validation and missing from generated types, so site code could not reliably resolve local media URLs from `meta.storageKey`.

### Minor Changes

- [#884](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/884) [`e2b3c6c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e2b3c6cd930d5fa6fc607a0b26fd796f5b0f98b2) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Removes the worker-isolate manifest cache and stops loading the manifest on public requests.

  The admin manifest (collection schemas, plugins, taxonomies) is built fresh from the live database on every admin request via constant-shape queries (`SchemaRegistry.listCollectionsWithFields()` — one collection query plus one batched field query, chunked at the D1 bound-parameter limit; two queries in practice for typical sites), deduplicated within a single request by `requestCached`. Logged-out / public requests no longer touch it at all — the global middleware no longer pre-loads `locals.emdashManifest`. Admin routes that need it call `await emdash.getManifest()`.

  This closes the cross-isolate staleness bug class behind #776, #873, #876, and #877 by elimination: there is no cache to invalidate, so there is nothing to fan out across warm sibling isolates on Cloudflare Workers, and there is nothing to leave stale after a fire-and-forget delete is cancelled at response-time.

  **Breaking changes**
  - `locals.emdash.invalidateManifest` is removed. The shim that survived earlier was a misnomer once the manifest cache itself was gone. Plugin code that called this after schema changes should switch to `locals.emdash.invalidateUrlPatternCache` (the only side effect that survived) — or drop the call entirely if the mutation didn't affect collection URL patterns (field/taxonomy/plugin mutations don't).
  - `locals.emdashManifest` is removed. Read it via `await locals.emdash.getManifest()` instead. The only in-tree consumers were the admin manifest endpoint and the WordPress importer routes, both updated.
  - `EmDashRuntime.invalidateManifest()` is removed. `EmDashRuntime.getManifest()` is preserved with the same signature; its body now skips the cache layer.

  **Performance**

  The admin manifest build is now O(1) query shapes (one for collections, one batched query for the fields of every returned collection, chunked at the D1 bound-parameter limit) instead of N+1. This is the cost the cache was hiding; the rebuild is cheap enough to run per request.

- [#731](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/731) [`9dfc65c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9dfc65c42c04c41088e0c8f5a8ca4347643e2fea) Thanks [@drudge](https://github.com/drudge)! - Adds a `media_picker` Block Kit element: a thumbnail preview with a modal library picker and mime-type filter. Usable in plugin block forms and in Block Kit field widgets. The stored value is the selected asset's URL string, so it is value-compatible with a plain `text_input` — existing content continues to work after swapping. The `mime_type_filter` is restricted to image MIME types (`image/` or `image/<subtype>`); wildcards and non-image types are rejected.

- [#809](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/809) [`e7df21f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e7df21f0adca795cdb233d6e64cd543ead7e2347) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds an optional `category` field to `PortableTextBlockConfig` for plugin-contributed block types. Plugins can now choose how their blocks are grouped in the admin slash menu (e.g. "Sections", "Marketing", "Media", "Layout") instead of always falling under "Embeds". Existing plugins that omit the field continue to render under "Embeds" exactly as before.

- [#890](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/890) [`8ae227c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8ae227cceade5c9852897c7b56f89e7422ee82a1) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `publishedAt` to `content_publish` (MCP and REST) and exposes `seo`, `bylines`, and `publishedAt` on the MCP `content_update` tool.

  `content_publish` now accepts an optional ISO 8601 `publishedAt` to backdate a publish, which is useful when migrating content from another CMS or correcting a historical publish date. The override requires the `content:publish_any` permission. Without it, the existing `published_at` is preserved on re-publish (idempotent) and falls back to the current time on first publish.

  The MCP `content_update` tool previously dropped `seo`, `bylines`, and `publishedAt` even though the underlying handler accepted them. Callers had to fall back to raw SQL against `_emdash_seo` and `_emdash_content_bylines` to set these fields. They now flow through the MCP tool and are persisted in the same transaction as field updates. Setting `publishedAt` requires `content:publish_any`, mirroring the REST PUT route. Closes #621 and #622.

- [#800](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/800) [`e2d5d16`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e2d5d160acea4444945b1ea79c80ca9ce138965b) Thanks [@csfalcao](https://github.com/csfalcao)! - Adds support for accepting passkey assertions from multiple origins that share an `rpId`, for deployments reachable under several hostnames (apex + preview/staging) under one registrable parent. Declare additional origins via `EmDashConfig.allowedOrigins` (in `astro.config.mjs`) or the `EMDASH_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated); the two sources merge at runtime. EmDash validates the merged set against `siteUrl` and rejects dead config (non-subdomain entries, IP-literal `siteUrl`, trailing dots, empty labels) with source-attributed errors. `PasskeyConfig.origin: string` is replaced by `PasskeyConfig.origins: string[]`.

- [#837](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/837) [`e81aa0f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e81aa0f717be11bacdff30ed9bbc454824268555) Thanks [@netogregorio](https://github.com/netogregorio)! - Make the preview URL pattern locale-aware. `getPreviewUrl()` now accepts a `{locale}` placeholder and a `locale` option (empty string collapses adjacent slashes so default-locale entries on `prefixDefaultLocale: false` sites stay unprefixed). The `POST /_emdash/api/content/{collection}/{id}/preview-url` route resolves the locale automatically from the entry and the site's i18n config, and reads a project-wide default pattern from the new `EMDASH_PREVIEW_PATH_PATTERN` env var so the admin's "View on site" link can match locale-prefixed routes (e.g. `/{locale}/{id}`).

- [#811](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/811) [`cee403d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cee403d5c008feb9ca60bb7201e151b828737743) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds a centralized secrets module and `emdash secrets` CLI command group.
  The preview HMAC secret and commenter-IP hash salt are now generated and
  persisted in the options table on first need, with `EMDASH_PREVIEW_SECRET`
  and `EMDASH_IP_SALT` as optional env overrides. This replaces the previous
  empty-string preview fallback (which silently disabled token verification)
  and the hardcoded `"emdash-ip-salt"` constant (which was correlatable
  across installs).

  Adds:
  - `emdash secrets generate [--write <file> [--force]]` — emits a fresh
    `EMDASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (versioned `emdash_enc_v1_<43 chars>` format),
    optionally writes it to `.dev.vars` or `.env` idempotently.
  - `emdash secrets fingerprint <key>` — prints the kid (8-char fingerprint)
    for a key without exposing its value.

  Lays groundwork for plugin-secret encryption-at-rest in a follow-up.

  Deprecates:
  - `emdash auth secret` — kept as a working alias that prints a stderr
    deprecation note. Will be removed in a future minor. `EMDASH_AUTH_SECRET`
    itself is now legacy: it's only consulted as a fallback IP-salt source
    for upgrade compatibility (so existing installs keep stable
    commenter-IP hashes). New installs don't need to set it.

  API changes:
  - `fingerprintKey()` (exported from `emdash`'s config module) now
    validates its input and throws `EmDashSecretsError` for malformed or
    non-canonical keys, where it previously silently hashed any string.
    Callers that want the previous "fingerprint anything" behavior should
    hash the input themselves with `crypto.subtle.digest`.

  User-visible side effects on upgrade:
  - Installs that hadn't set `EMDASH_PREVIEW_SECRET` get a fresh random
    preview secret on first start, which invalidates any outstanding
    preview URLs (typically short-lived).
  - Installs that hadn't set `EMDASH_AUTH_SECRET` get a fresh random IP
    salt, resetting active comment rate-limit windows once.
  - Installs that did set `EMDASH_AUTH_SECRET` keep the same IP salt via a
    legacy fallback, so existing rate-limit data carries over.
  - If you sign preview URLs from a separate process without access to the
    EmDash database (e.g. a remote preview Worker), you must continue to
    set `EMDASH_PREVIEW_SECRET` in **both** processes. Processes that share
    the database converge on the same auto-generated value automatically;
    the env override is only needed when the verifying process can't read
    the options table.

- [#816](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/816) [`d4be24f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d4be24f478a0c8d0a7bba3c299e11105bba3ed94) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Unifies plugin capability names under a single `<resource>[.<sub-resource>]:<verb>[:<qualifier>]` formula so capabilities read like RBAC permissions, separates hook-registration permissions from data-access ones for clearer audits, and replaces the overloaded `:any` qualifier with the more conspicuous `:unrestricted`. Old names are still accepted with `@deprecated` warnings; `emdash plugin bundle` and `emdash plugin validate` warn for each deprecated name and `emdash plugin publish` refuses manifests that still use them.

  The Cloudflare sandbox bridge and HTTP fetch helper now enforce canonical names (`content:read`, `content:write`, `media:read`, `media:write`, `users:read`, `network:request`, `network:request:unrestricted`). Manifests that still declare legacy names continue to work — the runner normalizes capabilities before passing them into the bridge, so installed plugins with `read:content` resolve to `content:read` and reach the same code path.

  | Old                 | New                              |
  | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | `read:content`      | `content:read`                   |
  | `write:content`     | `content:write`                  |
  | `read:media`        | `media:read`                     |
  | `write:media`       | `media:write`                    |
  | `read:users`        | `users:read`                     |
  | `network:fetch`     | `network:request`                |
  | `network:fetch:any` | `network:request:unrestricted`   |
  | `email:provide`     | `hooks.email-transport:register` |
  | `email:intercept`   | `hooks.email-events:register`    |
  | `page:inject`       | `hooks.page-fragments:register`  |

  Existing installs keep working — manifests are normalized at every external boundary and `diffCapabilities` normalizes both sides so version upgrades that only rename do not trigger a "capability changed" prompt. Deprecated names will be removed in the next minor.

### Patch Changes

- [#858](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/858) [`e0dc6fb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e0dc6fb8adadc0e048f3f314d62bfa98d9bb48d4) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Adds CSS custom-property hooks to portable-text block defaults in `Image`, `Embed`, `Gallery`, and `Break` so host sites can theme figcaptions and horizontal rules without overriding component CSS. Resolution order is `--emdash-caption-color` → `--color-muted` → `#666` for captions, `--emdash-break-color` → `--color-border` → `#e0e0e0` for the break line, and `--emdash-break-dots-color` → `--color-muted` → `#999` for break dots. Backward compatible: sites that don't define any of these variables get the previous hex defaults; sites that already expose the conventional `--color-muted` / `--color-border` tokens (e.g. the blog template) now get correct dark-mode theming automatically.

- [#838](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/838) [`c22fb3a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c22fb3a10d445f12cca91620c9258d50695afa44) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Removes a redundant `SELECT id, author_id` lookup that fired after every collection-list and entry fetch when computing the byline-fallback for entries without explicit credits. The column is already on the row data, so it is now read directly. Saves up to one round-trip per list query and two on post-detail routes (~30 fewer queries across the perf-fixture suite).

- [#805](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/805) [`6a4e9b8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6a4e9b8b0fa6064989224a42b14de435f487a76f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes data loss in the visual-editing inline editor for plugin-contributed Portable Text block types. Previously, custom blocks like `marketing.hero` lost every field except `id` when the page was opened in edit mode, and the next save persisted the loss. Blocks now round-trip losslessly and render as a read-only placeholder labelled with the block type.

- [#702](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/702) [`0ee372a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0ee372a7f33eecce7d90e12624923d2d9c132adf) Thanks [@ilicfilip](https://github.com/ilicfilip)! - Adds `@emdash-cms/plugin-field-kit` — composable field widgets for `json` fields. Four widgets (`object-form`, `list`, `grid`, `tags`) are configured entirely through seed `options` so site builders don't need to write React to get a usable editing UI. Widgets store clean JSON (no nesting, no mutation of shape), so removing the plugin leaves valid data in the database. See discussion #571 for background.

  Widens `FieldDescriptor.options` to `Array<{ value: string; label: string }> | Record<string, unknown>` so plugin widgets can accept arbitrary widget config (not only enum choices). The array shape for `select` / `multiSelect` continues to work unchanged.

- [#861](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/861) [`22a16ee`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/22a16eed607a4e81391ecb6c45fe2e59aaca92fe) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes "Cannot find module 'kysely'" at runtime after `astro build` followed by `astro preview` or `node dist/server/entry.mjs` on Node deployments using SQLite or libSQL (#741). The SQLite and libSQL dialect runtime modules used CJS `require("kysely")` and `require("better-sqlite3")`, ostensibly to defer loading at config time — though in practice these modules are only ever loaded at runtime via `virtual:emdash/dialect`, so the deferral served no purpose. Vite preserved those literal `require()` calls in the bundled SSR chunks; under pnpm's strict `node_modules` layout, Node's CJS resolver could not find `kysely` (a transitive dep of `emdash`) from the user's `dist/server/chunks/` directory. The dialect modules now use static imports — matching the existing `db/postgres.ts` adapter — so Vite resolves the deps correctly at build time.

- [#847](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/847) [`1e2b024`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1e2b02486ee0407e4f50b8342ba1a9e7d060e405) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes site favicon injection so user-configured favicons render on the public site, including SVG favicons in Chromium browsers (#831). `EmDashHead` now emits a `<link rel="icon">` tag with the correct `type` attribute (e.g. `image/svg+xml`) sourced from the stored media's MIME type. The bundled templates and demos have been updated to drop their per-template favicon link in favour of the centralized injection; existing user sites that still emit their own `<link rel="icon">` continue to work because browsers tolerate the duplicate.

  `MediaReference` now carries `url`, `contentType`, `width`, and `height` when resolved via `resolveMediaReference`, so callers can emit correct head tags without a second round-trip to the media table.

- [#851](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/851) [`81662e9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/81662e98fcf1ad0ee880d4f1af96271c527d7423) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes admin branding (logo, siteName, favicon) configured via the integration's `admin` option not being delivered to the React admin SPA. The `/_emdash/api/manifest` route now reads admin branding from the per-request config plumbed through middleware (the same source `admin.astro` already used), instead of a build-time global that was never assigned.

- [#857](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/857) [`2f22f57`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2f22f57abadf305cf6d3ce07ee78290178e032d1) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes a migration race on D1 where two concurrent Workers isolates could both try to apply the same migration, causing one to fail with `UNIQUE constraint failed: _emdash_migrations.name`. The losing isolate would throw before reaching auto-seed, leaving the manifest cache empty and the admin UI reporting collections as not found while the API reported them correctly. `runMigrations` now treats this specific error as benign, waits for the concurrent migrator to finish, and verifies the schema is fully migrated before returning success. Closes #762.

- [#856](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/856) [`ef3f076`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ef3f076c8112e9dffc2a87c019e5521e823f5e86) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes `npm install` peer dependency conflicts (#819) by removing `@tanstack/react-query` and `@tanstack/react-router` from `peerDependencies`. These libraries are internal implementation details of the bundled admin UI (`@emdash-cms/admin`) and consuming Astro apps don't import them directly. Listing them as peers of `emdash` was forcing every npm-based install to install and resolve them at the top level, which produced ERESOLVE errors and bloat. The admin package continues to declare them as its own runtime dependencies.

- [#817](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/817) [`a9c29ea`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a9c29ea584300f6cf67206bedcb1d39f05ea1c26) Thanks [@all3f0r1](https://github.com/all3f0r1)! - Fixes redirect middleware so 301/302 rules from `_emdash_redirects` actually fire for unauthenticated visitors. Previously, the lookup was silently skipped on the public-visitor branch because `locals.emdash.db` is intentionally omitted there — only logged-in admins, edit-mode sessions and preview tokens ever saw redirects (so WordPress migration 301s, manual rewrites and `Auto: slug change` rows did nothing for real traffic, and `hits` / `_emdash_404_log` stayed at zero). The middleware now falls back to `getDb()` (ALS-aware) when `locals.emdash.db` is absent. Resolves #808.

- [#874](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/874) [`d5f7c48`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d5f7c481a507868f470361cfd715a5828640d45a) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes `EmDashRuntime.invalidateManifest()` leaving the persisted manifest cache row stale on Cloudflare Workers. The D1 row delete was a fire-and-forget promise — on Workers, unawaited work is cancelled when the isolate is torn down post-response, so `options.emdash:manifest_cache` was almost never actually wiped after a schema mutation. Cold-starting isolates downstream then adopted the pre-mutation snapshot and served `Collection '<slug>' not found` until something else cleared the row. The delete now goes through `after()`, which hands it to `ctx.waitUntil` under workerd. (#873)

- [#839](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/839) [`0d98c62`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0d98c620a5f407648f3b7f3cbd30b642c74be607) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Caches the `site:*` settings prefix-scan across requests within a worker isolate. Site settings change rarely; reading them once per route was wasted work. Writes via `setSiteSettings()` invalidate the cache so other isolates pick up changes within their lifetime.

- [#840](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/840) [`64bf5b9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/64bf5b98125ca18ec26f7e0e65a71fcbe71fd44f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Reduces duplicate queries on pages that render multiple taxonomy or "recent posts" widgets. `getTaxonomyDef(name)` now reuses the full taxonomy-defs list when it has already been loaded in the same request, and `getEmDashCollection` buckets small limits so a post-detail page asking for 4 posts in the body and 5 in a sidebar widget shares one fetch instead of two. Cuts ~6 queries from the perf-fixture post-detail render.

- [#803](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/803) [`0041d76`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0041d7699b32b77b4cd2ecd77b97340f0dd3abce) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Fixes migrations 034 and 035 so they can safely re-run when a previous attempt left the schema partially applied without recording it in `_emdash_migrations`. Resolves the "index already exists" error reported on upgrade from 0.1.1 to 0.6.0+.

- [#869](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/869) [`a8bac5d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a8bac5d7216e185b1bd9a2aaaeaa9a0306ab066e) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes autosave validation errors on content seeded from the blog,
  portfolio, and starter templates (issue #867).

  Two related issues:
  - `_key` was strictly required on Portable Text blocks by the
    generated Zod schema, but the rest of the block schema is
    `.passthrough()` and the editor regenerates `_key` on every change,
    so requiring it on input rejected legitimate seed/import data
    without protecting any real invariant. `_key` is now optional in the
    validator.
  - The portfolio template shipped `featured_image` as bare URL strings.
    `image` fields validate as `{ id, ... }` objects, so any user who
    edited a different field on a portfolio entry hit
    `featured_image: expected object, received string`. The portfolio
    seeds now use `$media` references in the same shape as the blog
    template, and every shipped template seed has stable `_key`s on its
    Portable Text nodes.

  A regression test runs every shipped template seed through the same
  validator the autosave endpoint uses, so future template changes that
  break this invariant fail before release.

- [#882](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/882) [`5b6f059`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5b6f059d06175ae0cb740d1ba32867d1ec6b2249) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the seed virtual module to also look at the conventional `seed/seed.json` path when no `.emdash/seed.json` or `package.json#emdash.seed` pointer is configured. Without this fallback, a site that only had `seed/seed.json` would silently fall through to the built-in default seed -- the setup wizard would not offer demo content, and the wrong schema would be applied. The loader now warns when it falls through to the default seed so misconfiguration is loud during dev.

- [#855](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/855) [`a86ff80`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a86ff80836fed175508ff06f744c7ad6b805627c) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes Astro session lookups firing on every anonymous public SSR request (#733). The middleware now skips `context.session.get("user")` when no `astro-session` cookie is present, which on Cloudflare Workers (where the Astro session backend is KV) was turning normal anonymous traffic into a flood of KV read misses. Logged-in editors, admin routes, edit/preview flows, and any request that actually carries the session cookie continue to read the session as before.

- [#853](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/853) [`eb6dbd0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/eb6dbd056717fd076a8b5fa807d91516a00f5f2f) Thanks [@drudge](https://github.com/drudge)! - Fixes content saves on collections with boolean fields. Boolean fields map to `INTEGER` columns and the repository writes booleans as `0/1`, but never converts them back on read, so a GET → edit → POST round-trip surfaced numbers where the per-collection zod schema expected booleans, and every save was rejected. The boolean field schema now coerces the `0/1` shape to real booleans at the validation boundary; other numbers and strings still fail validation as before.

### Minor Changes

- [#679](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/679) [`493e317`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/493e3172d4539d8e041e6d2bf2d7d2dc89b2a10d) Thanks [@drudge](https://github.com/drudge)! - Adds a `repeater` Block Kit element: array-of-objects with scalar sub-fields, drag-to-reorder, and collapsible item cards. Plugin block forms can now capture repeating data (FAQ rows, carousel slides, card grids) inline in the portable-text editor.

- [#779](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/779) [`e402890`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e402890fcd8647fdfe847bb34aa9f9e7094473dd) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `settings_get` and `settings_update` MCP tools so agents can read and update site-wide settings (title, tagline, logo, favicon, URL, posts-per-page, date format, timezone, social, SEO). `settings_get` resolves media references (logo/favicon/seo.defaultOgImage) to URLs; `settings_update` is a partial update that preserves omitted fields. New `settings:read` (EDITOR+) and `settings:manage` (ADMIN) API token scopes back the tools, with matching options in the personal API token settings UI.

- [#777](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/777) [`3eca9d5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3eca9d54be03a803d35e112f4114f85f53a23acd) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - **Behavior change** — MCP `taxonomy_list_terms` now uses an opaque base64 keyset cursor over `(label, id)` instead of the previous raw term-id cursor. The new cursor is robust to concurrent term deletion: it encodes a position in sort space rather than a reference to a specific row. **MCP clients that persisted page cursors across this upgrade should drop them and restart pagination** — pre-upgrade cursors will return `INVALID_CURSOR`.

  Adds parent-chain validation to `taxonomy_create_term` (previously only `taxonomy_update_term` validated): rejects non-existent parents, cross-taxonomy parents, self-parent on update, cycles on update, and parent chains exceeding 100 ancestors. Existing taxonomies with chains over the depth limit continue to function but cannot accept new descendants until the chain is shortened.

- [#675](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/675) [`b6cb2e6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b6cb2e6c7001d37a0558e22953eba41013457528) Thanks [@eyupcanakman](https://github.com/eyupcanakman)! - Renders local media through storage `publicUrl` when configured. `EmDashImage` and the Portable Text image block now call a new `locals.emdash.getPublicMediaUrl()` helper, so R2 and S3 deployments with a custom domain serve images from that domain. `S3Storage.getPublicUrl` now returns the `/_emdash/api/media/file/{key}` path when no `publicUrl` is set (previously `{endpoint}/{bucket}/{key}`).

- [#398](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/398) [`31333dc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/31333dc593e2b9128113e4e923455209f11853fd) Thanks [@simnaut](https://github.com/simnaut)! - Adds pluggable auth provider system with AT Protocol as the first plugin-based provider. Refactors GitHub and Google OAuth from hardcoded buttons into the same `AuthProviderDescriptor` interface. All auth methods (passkey, AT Protocol, GitHub, Google) are equal options on the login page and setup wizard.

### Patch Changes

- [#777](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/777) [`3eca9d5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3eca9d54be03a803d35e112f4114f85f53a23acd) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes MCP ownership checks failing with an internal error on content that has no `authorId` (seed-imported rows). Admins and editors can now edit, publish, unpublish, schedule, and restore such items; users with only own-content permissions get a clean permission error.

- [#777](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/777) [`3eca9d5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3eca9d54be03a803d35e112f4114f85f53a23acd) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes content create / update silently accepting invalid data: required fields are now enforced, select / multiSelect values must match the configured options, and reference fields must resolve to a real, non-trashed target. Errors surface with a structured `VALIDATION_ERROR` code and a message naming every offending field.

- [#670](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/670) [`37ada52`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/37ada52a62e94f4f0581f4356ba55dc978863f49) Thanks [@segmentationfaulter](https://github.com/segmentationfaulter)! - Change text direction of input fields and tiptap editor depending upon the language entered

- [#688](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/688) [`0557b62`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0557b62ec646e49eeb5e28686d50b4e8746338be) Thanks [@corwinperdomo](https://github.com/corwinperdomo)! - Fixes the Settings > Email admin page so active `email:beforeSend` / `email:afterSend` middleware plugins are listed (previously always empty). Adds `HookPipeline.getHookProviders()` for enumerating non-exclusive hook providers.

- [#673](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/673) [`5a581d9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5a581d966cc1da72637a76ad42a7ac3b81ec59c3) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Fixes WordPress media import to emit relative `/_emdash/api/media/file/...` URLs instead of absolute ones, matching every other media endpoint. Imported media is now recognized by `INTERNAL_MEDIA_PREFIX` for enrichment, and no longer pins URLs to the origin that happened to serve the import request (breaking renders on a different port or behind a reverse proxy).

- [#750](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/750) [`0ecd3b4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0ecd3b4901eb721825b36eb4812506032e43da14) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Make the admin collection list column headers sortable. `Title`, `Status`, `Locale`, and `Date` are now clickable buttons that toggle direction; the current sort state is exposed via `aria-sort` on the `<th>` so screen readers announce it correctly.

  The server's `orderBy` field whitelist now accepts `status`, `locale`, and `name` alongside the existing date fields — unchanged from a security standpoint, the repo still rejects unknown field names to prevent column enumeration.

  Callers of `<ContentList>` that don't pass `onSortChange` render the previous static-label headers, so legacy integrations (e.g. the content picker) are unaffected.

- [`3138432`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/31384322537070db8c35e4f93f4ffe8225d784d6) Thanks [@r2sake](https://github.com/r2sake)! - Fixes hydration of the inline PortableText editor on pnpm projects by aliasing `use-sync-external-store/shim` to the main `use-sync-external-store` package. The shim is a CJS-only React<18 polyfill imported transitively by `@tiptap/react`; under pnpm's virtual store Vite cannot pre-bundle it, and the browser receives raw `module.exports` which fails to load as ESM (`SyntaxError: ... does not provide an export named 'useSyncExternalStore'`). The aliases redirect to React's built-in `useSyncExternalStore` (peer-dep floor is React 18), so users no longer need to add the workaround themselves in `astro.config.mjs`.

- [#755](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/755) [`70924cd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/70924cd19b4227b3a1ecfad6618f1a80530a378b) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Fixes the WordPress importer so collections created mid-import are visible to the subsequent execute phase.

  `POST /_emdash/api/import/wordpress/prepare` now calls `emdash.invalidateManifest()` when it creates new collections or fields. Without this, the DB-persisted manifest cache (`emdash:manifest_cache` in the `options` table) stays stale and the `execute` request reports `Collection "<slug>" does not exist` for every item destined for a freshly created collection — a bug that survived dev-server restarts and required manually deleting the cache row.

- [#757](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/757) [`1f0f6f2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1f0f6f2507d026f2b5c60c254432bfc327b3474f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Removes two redundant in-scope database queries from the FTS verify-and-repair path. The inner block re-fetched searchable fields and search config that were already loaded in the outer scope of the same method. No behavior change.

- [#777](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/777) [`3eca9d5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3eca9d54be03a803d35e112f4114f85f53a23acd) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes paginated list endpoints silently returning the first page when given a malformed cursor. Bad cursors now produce a structured `INVALID_CURSOR` error so client pagination bugs surface immediately.

  **Note for plugin authors:** the low-level `decodeCursor` export from `emdash/database/repositories` now throws `InvalidCursorError` on invalid input instead of returning `null`. Direct callers (rare — most code uses `findMany`-style helpers that handle this internally) should wrap the call in `try`/`catch` or migrate to the higher-level helpers.

- [#777](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/777) [`3eca9d5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3eca9d54be03a803d35e112f4114f85f53a23acd) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes `schema_create_collection` MCP tool to apply its documented default of `['drafts', 'revisions']` for `supports` when omitted.

- [#189](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/189) [`f5658f0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f5658f052f7294039f7ea8c5eb8b49af263beb0d) Thanks [@Sayeem3051](https://github.com/Sayeem3051)! - Add url and email plugin setting field types (Issue #175)

Errors returned by MCP tools now include a stable `[CODE]` prefix in the message text and a `_meta.code` field on the response envelope, so MCP clients can distinguish failure modes (e.g. NOT_FOUND, CONFLICT, VALIDATION_ERROR) instead of seeing only a generic message.

Previously, restore overwrote the live row directly and left any pending draft unchanged, opposite to the documented contract ("Replaces the current draft..."). The response is also hydrated so the returned `data` reflects the post-restore state.

  Behavior is unchanged for collections that do not support revisions.

Previously SQLite's FTS5 `snippet()` function spliced literal `<mark>` tags around matched terms but left the surrounding text unescaped, meaning a post title like `Hello <script>alert(1)</script>` would render as live markup. Templates and components rendering snippets directly were exposed; the in-tree `LiveSearch` component already worked around this client-side. Snippets now contain only HTML-escaped source text plus literal `<mark>...</mark>` highlight tags, matching the documented contract.

Both paths now match specifically on `"unique constraint failed"` or `"duplicate key"` (avoiding false positives where the word "unique" appears in unrelated error text), and produce sanitized `SLUG_CONFLICT` / `CONFLICT` messages so raw database error text — including Postgres-internal index names — no longer leaks to API consumers. Clients that pattern-match the previous unsanitized messages will see normalized text instead.

Admin UI expects `content` to already be a parsed PortableText array and `componentId`/`componentProps`/`menuName` in camelCase, so expanding a content widget in `/_emdash/admin/widgets` produced an empty editor. All four route handlers (`GET /widget-areas`, `GET /widget-areas/:name`, `POST /widget-areas/:name/widgets`, `PUT /widget-areas/:name/widgets/:id`) now run their results through `rowToWidget`, which was made module-exported.

Existing tokens with `content:write` continue to work for those operations: `content:write` now implicitly grants `menus:manage` and `taxonomies:manage` so PATs issued before the split keep their effective permissions. The reverse implication does not hold — a token with only `menus:manage` cannot create or edit content.

### Minor Changes

- [#705](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/705) [`8ebdf1a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8ebdf1af65764cc4b72624e7758c4a666817aade) Thanks [@eba8](https://github.com/eba8)! - Adds admin white-labeling support via `admin` config in `astro.config.mjs`. Agencies can set a custom logo, site name, and favicon for the admin panel, separate from public site settings.

- [#742](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/742) [`c26442b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c26442be9887f1e3d3df37db5ccda6b260820a77) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `trustedProxyHeaders` config option so self-hosted deployments behind a reverse proxy can declare which client-IP headers to trust. Used by auth rate limits (magic-link, signup, passkey, OAuth device flow) and the public comment endpoint — without it, every request on a non-Cloudflare deployment was treated as "unknown" and rate limits were effectively disabled.

  Set the option in `astro.config.mjs`:

  ```js
  emdash({
  	trustedProxyHeaders: ["x-real-ip"], // nginx, Caddy, Traefik
  });
  ```

  or via the `EMDASH_TRUSTED_PROXY_HEADERS` env var (comma-separated). Headers are tried in order; values ending in `forwarded-for` are parsed as comma-separated lists.

  Also removes the user-agent-hash fallback on the comment endpoint. The fallback was meant to give anonymous commenters on non-Cloudflare deployments something approximating per-user rate limiting, but the UA is trivially rotatable; requests with no trusted IP now share a stricter "unknown" bucket. Operators behind a reverse proxy should set `trustedProxyHeaders` to restore per-IP bucketing.

  **Only set `trustedProxyHeaders` when you control the reverse proxy.** Trusting a forwarded-IP header from the open internet lets any client spoof their IP and defeats rate limiting.

### Patch Changes

- [#745](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/745) [`7186961`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7186961d3cbf706c1248e9e40b14b1a545ce8586) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes an unauthenticated denial-of-service via the 404 log. Every 404 response previously inserted a new row into `_emdash_404_log`, so an attacker could grow the database without bound by requesting unique nonexistent URLs. Repeat hits to the same path now dedup into a single row with a `hits` counter and `last_seen_at` timestamp, referrer and user-agent headers are truncated to bounded lengths, and the log is capped at 10,000 rows with oldest-first eviction.

- [#739](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/739) [`e9ecec2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e9ecec2d2dfb20ab4c413fb593a09a9f6d0fb27e) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Fixes the REST content API silently stripping `publishedAt` on create/update and `createdAt` on create. Importers can now preserve original publish and creation dates on migrated content. Gated behind `content:publish_any` (EDITOR+) so regular contributors cannot backdate posts. `createdAt` is intentionally not accepted on update — `created_at` is treated as immutable.

- [#732](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/732) [`e3e18aa`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e3e18aae92d31cf22efd11a0ba06110de24a076a) Thanks [@jcheese1](https://github.com/jcheese1)! - Fixes select dropdown appearing behind dialog by removing explicit z-index values and adding `isolate` to the admin body for proper stacking context.

- [#695](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/695) [`fae63bd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fae63bdae8ff798a420379c36d3d05e54ea3628a) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes `emdash seed` so entries declared with `"status": "published"` are actually published. Previously the seed wrote the content row with `status: "published"` and a `published_at` timestamp but never created a live revision, so the admin UI showed "Save & Publish" instead of "Unpublish" and `live_revision_id` stayed null. The seed now promotes published entries to a live revision on both create and update paths.

- [#744](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/744) [`30d8fe0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/30d8fe00025e058c71c8bfcd296946bb2042c4a7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes a setup-window admin hijack by binding `/setup/admin` and `/setup/admin/verify` to a per-session nonce cookie. Previously an unauthenticated attacker who could reach a site during first-time setup could POST to `/setup/admin` between the legitimate admin's email submission and passkey verification, overwriting the stored email — the admin account would then be created with the attacker's address. The admin route now mints a cryptographically random nonce, stores it in setup state, and sets it as an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, `/_emdash/`-scoped cookie; the verify route rejects any request whose cookie does not match in constant time.

- [#685](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/685) [`d4a95bf`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d4a95bf313855e97108dfec4de3ab35f1a85f8ba) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes visual editing: clicking an editable field now opens the inline editor instead of always opening the admin in a new tab. The toolbar's manifest fetch was reading `manifest.collections` directly but the `/_emdash/api/manifest` endpoint wraps its payload in `{ data: … }`, so every field-kind lookup returned `null` and every click fell through to the admin-new-tab fallback.

- [#743](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/743) [`a31db7d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a31db7dcc6d9ddb09328eec815d255a4976ce3b8) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Locks `emdash:site_url` after the first setup call so a spoofed Host header on a later step of the wizard can't overwrite it. Config (`siteUrl`) and env (`EMDASH_SITE_URL`) paths already took precedence; this is a defence-in-depth guard for deployments that rely on the request-origin fallback.

- [#737](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/737) [`adb118c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/adb118c99d867be7b17714798e1e565ccdf096e4) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Rate-limits the self-signup request endpoint to prevent abuse. `POST /_emdash/api/auth/signup/request` now allows 3 requests per 5 minutes per IP, matching the existing limit on magic-link/send. Over-limit requests return the same generic success response as allowed-but-ignored requests, so the limit isn't observable to callers.

- [#738](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/738) [`080a4f1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/080a4f1efdd793cddd49767d8b18cd53162f39e3) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Strengthens SSRF protection on the import pipeline against DNS-rebinding. The `validateExternalUrl` helper now also blocks known wildcard DNS services (`nip.io`, `sslip.io`, `xip.io`, `traefik.me`, `lvh.me`, `localtest.me`) and trailing-dot FQDN forms of blocked hostnames. A new `resolveAndValidateExternalUrl` resolves the target hostname via DNS-over-HTTPS (Cloudflare) and rejects if any returned IP is in a private range. `ssrfSafeFetch` and the plugin unrestricted-fetch path now use the DNS-aware validator on every hop. This adds two DoH round-trips per outbound request; self-hosted admins whose egress blocks `cloudflare-dns.com` can inject a custom resolver via `setDefaultDnsResolver`.

- [#736](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/736) [`81fe93b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/81fe93bc675581ddd0161eaabbe7a3471ec76529) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Restricts Subscriber-role access to draft, scheduled, and trashed content. Subscribers retain `content:read` for member-only published content but no longer see non-published items via the REST API or MCP server. Adds a new `content:read_drafts` permission (Contributor and above) that gates `/compare`, `/revisions`, `/trash`, `/preview-url`, and the corresponding MCP tools.

### Minor Changes

- [#626](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/626) [`1859347`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/18593475bb8e30ce1aab55d72903d02dbf3fd0cb) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds eager hydration of taxonomy terms on `getEmDashCollection` and `getEmDashEntry` results. Each entry now exposes a `data.terms` field keyed by taxonomy name (e.g. `post.data.terms.tag`, `post.data.terms.category`), populated via a single batched JOIN query alongside byline hydration. Templates that previously looped and called `getEntryTerms(collection, id, taxonomy)` per entry can read `entry.data.terms` directly and skip the N+1 round-trip.

  New exports: `getAllTermsForEntries`, `invalidateTermCache`.

  Reserved field slugs now also block `terms`, `bylines`, and `byline` at schema-creation time to prevent new fields shadowing the hydrated values. Existing installs that already have a user-defined field with any of those slugs will see the hydrated value overwrite the stored value on read (consistent with the pre-existing behavior of `bylines` / `byline` hydration); rename the field to keep its data accessible.

- [#600](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/600) [`9295cc1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9295cc199f72c9b9adff236e4a72ba412604493f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds Noto Sans as the default admin UI font via the Astro Font API. Fonts are downloaded from Google at build time and self-hosted. The base font covers Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Devanagari, and Vietnamese. Additional scripts (Arabic, CJK, Hebrew, Thai, etc.) can be added via the new `fonts.scripts` config option. Set `fonts: false` to disable and use system fonts.

### Patch Changes

- [#648](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/648) [`ada4ac7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ada4ac7105f72a96eaf4ce3d884d705d8aba0119) Thanks [@CacheMeOwside](https://github.com/CacheMeOwside)! - Adds the missing `url` field type for seed files, content type builder, and content editor with client-side URL validation.

- [#658](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/658) [`f279320`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f279320ef49c68662c8936db15e21f46cb57e82b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `after(fn)` — a helper for deferring bookkeeping work past the HTTP response. On Cloudflare it hands off to `waitUntil` (extending the worker's lifetime); on Node it fire-and-forgets (the event loop keeps the process alive for the next request anyway). Host binding is plumbed through a new `virtual:emdash/wait-until` virtual module so core stays runtime-neutral — Cloudflare-specific imports live in the integration layer, not in request-handling code.

  First use: cron stale-lock recovery (`_emdash_cron_tasks` UPDATE) now runs after the response ships instead of blocking it. On D1 this shaves a primary-routed write off the cold-start critical path.

  Usage:

  ```ts
  import { after } from "emdash";

  // Fire-and-forget; errors are caught and logged so a deferred task
  // never surfaces as an unhandled rejection.
  after(async () => {
  	await recordAuditEntry();
  });
  ```

Defaults to 52_428_800 (50 MB) — existing behaviour is unchanged.

- [#595](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/595) [`cfd01f3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cfd01f3bd484b38549a5a164ad006279a2024788) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes playground initialization crash caused by syncSearchState attempting first-time FTS enablement during field creation.

- [#663](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/663) [`38d637b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/38d637b520f8596758939ec08a7b534bb9550967) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Cache `getSiteSetting(key)` per-request. It was firing an uncached `options` table read on every call, so templates that pull several settings (or `EmDashHead` reading `seo` on every page render) paid N round-trips to the D1 primary instead of sharing one. Noticeable on colos far from the primary — APS/APE were seeing ~30–100 ms of avoidable warm-render latency per page.

  Wraps each key in `requestCached("siteSetting:${key}", ...)` so concurrent callers in a single render share the in-flight query.

- [#631](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/631) [`31d2f4e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/31d2f4edd5e84391e23f2eb6ff833e2fd4e51077) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Improves cold-start performance for anonymous page requests. Sites with D1 replicas far from the worker colo should see the biggest improvement; on the blog-demo the homepage cold request on Asia colos dropped from several seconds to under a second.

  Three underlying changes:
  - Search index health checks run on demand (on the first search request) rather than at worker boot, reclaiming the time a boot-time scan spent walking every searchable collection.
  - Module-scoped caches (manifest, taxonomy names, byline existence, taxonomy-assignment existence) are now reused across anonymous requests that route through D1 read replicas. They previously rebuilt on every request.
  - Cold-start Server-Timing headers break runtime init into sub-phases (`rt.db`, `rt.plugins`, etc.) so further regressions are easier to diagnose.

- [#605](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/605) [`445b3bf`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/445b3bfecf1f4cdc109be865685eb6ae6e0c06e6) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes D1 read replicas being bypassed for anonymous public page traffic. The middleware fast path now asks the database adapter for a per-request scoped Kysely, so anonymous reads land on the nearest replica instead of the primary-pinned singleton binding.

  All D1-specific semantics (Sessions API, constraint selection, bookmark cookie) live in `@emdash-cms/cloudflare/db/d1` behind a single `createRequestScopedDb(opts)` function. Core middleware has no D1-specific logic. Adapters opt in via a new `supportsRequestScope: boolean` flag on `DatabaseDescriptor`; `d1()` sets it to true.

  Other fixes in the same change:
  - Nested `runWithContext` calls in the request-context middleware now merge the parent context instead of replacing it, so an outer per-request db override is preserved through edit/preview flows.
  - Baseline security headers now forward Astro's cookie symbol across the response clone so `cookies.set()` calls in middleware survive.
  - Any write (authenticated or anonymous) now forces `first-primary`, so an anonymous form/comment POST isn't racing across replicas.
  - The session user is read once per request and reused in both the fast path and the full runtime init (previously read twice on authenticated public-page traffic).
  - Bookmark cookies are validated only for length (≤1024) and absence of control characters — no stricter shape check, so a future D1 bookmark format change won't silently degrade consistency.
  - The `!config` bail-out now still applies baseline security headers.
  - `__ec_d1_bookmark` references aligned to `__em_d1_bookmark` across runtime, docs, and JSDoc.

- [#654](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/654) [`943d540`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/943d54060eb6675dda643b09f7cdb80bbbe5d566) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Dedups repeat DB queries within a single page render. Measured against the query-count fixture:
  - The "has any bylines / has any taxonomy terms" probes were module-scoped singletons, but the bundler duplicates those modules across chunks — each chunk ended up with its own copy of the singleton, so the probe re-ran whenever a different chunk called the helper. Stored on `globalThis` with a Symbol key (same pattern as `request-context.ts`), so a single value is shared across all chunks now.
  - Wraps `getCollectionInfo`, `getTaxonomyDef`, `getTaxonomyTerms`, and `getEmDashCollection` in the request-scoped cache so two callers with the same arguments in the same render share a single query.

  Biggest wins land on pages that render multiple content-heavy components (a post detail page with comments, byline credits, and sidebar widgets). On the fixture post page: -3 queries cold / -1 warm under SQLite, -2 queries cold under D1.

Tags show a "Create" option when no match exists; categories get an "Add new" button below the list.

- [#606](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/606) [`c5ef0f5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c5ef0f5befda129e4040822ee341f8cd8bb5acaf) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Caches the manifest in memory and in the database to eliminate N+1 schema queries per request. Batches site info queries during initialization. Cold starts read 1 cached row instead of rebuilding from scratch.

- [#671](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/671) [`f839381`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f8393819e74b31c269ba6c5088eab1f40b438c62) Thanks [@jcheese1](https://github.com/jcheese1)! - Fixes MCP OAuth discovery and dynamic client registration so EmDash only advertises supported client registration mechanisms and rejects unsupported redirect URIs or token endpoint auth methods during client registration. Also exempts OAuth protocol endpoints (token, register, device code, device token) from the Origin-based CSRF check, since these endpoints are called cross-origin by design (MCP clients, CLIs, native apps) and carry no ambient credentials, and sends the required CORS headers so browser-based MCP clients can reach them.

- [#664](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/664) [`002d0ac`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/002d0accd87fc0b6983a3a45fd11227398837366) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - `getSiteSetting(key)` now transparently piggybacks on `getSiteSettings()` when the batch has already been loaded in the current request. If a parent template has called `getSiteSettings()` (which is request-cached), a later `getSiteSetting("seo")` — from `EmDashHead`, a plugin, or user code — reads the key from that cached result instead of firing its own round-trip. Falls back to a per-key cached query when nothing has been primed.

  Exposes `peekRequestCache(key)` for internal use by other helpers that want the same "read from a broader cached query if available" pattern.

  On the blog-demo fixture: the SEO call added in PR #613 now costs zero extra queries per page (it reads from the Base layout's existing `getSiteSettings()` result).

- [#465](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/465) [`0a61ef4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0a61ef412ef8d2643fa847caeddbe8b8933d3fc7) Thanks [@Pouf5](https://github.com/Pouf5)! - Fixes FTS5 tables not being created when a searchable collection is created or updated via the Admin UI.

- [#636](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/636) [`6d41fe1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6d41fe16539d09c53916b4ca41c515a29f8e0d4f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes two correctness issues from the #631 cold-start work:
  - `ensureSearchHealthy()` now runs against the runtime's singleton database instead of the per-request session-bound one. The verify step reads, but a corrupted index triggers a rebuild write, and D1 Sessions on a GET request uses `first-unconstrained` routing that's free to land on a replica. The singleton goes through the default binding, which the adapter correctly promotes to `first-primary` for writes.
  - The playground request-context middleware now sets `dbIsIsolated: true`. Without it, schema-derived caches (manifest, taxonomy defs, byline/term existence probes) could carry values across playground sessions that have independent schemas.

- [#627](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/627) [`b158e40`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b158e40de596e8ca3cb056495276ec97403c24d9) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Prime the request-scoped cache for `getEntryTerms` during collection and entry hydration. `getEmDashCollection` and `getEmDashEntry` already fetch taxonomy terms for their results via a single batched JOIN; now the same data is seeded into the per-request cache under the same keys `getEntryTerms` uses, so existing templates that still call `getEntryTerms(collection, id, taxonomy)` in a loop get cache hits instead of a serial DB round-trip per iteration.

  Empty-result entries are seeded with `[]` for every taxonomy that applies to the collection so "this post has no tags" also short-circuits without a query. Cache entries are scoped to the request context via ALS and GC'd with it.

- [#653](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/653) [`f97d6ab`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f97d6ab0f1995fe86862aeb20de65d0ee774699f) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds opt-in query instrumentation for performance regression testing. Setting `EMDASH_QUERY_LOG=1` causes the Kysely log hook to emit `[emdash-query-log]`-prefixed NDJSON on stdout for every DB query executed inside a request, tagged with the route, method, and an `X-Perf-Phase` header value. Zero runtime overhead when the flag is unset — the log option is only attached to Kysely when enabled.

  Also exposes the helpers at `emdash/database/instrumentation` so first-party adapters (e.g. `@emdash-cms/cloudflare`) can wire the same hook into their per-request Kysely instances.

- [#613](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/613) [`e67b940`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e67b94056c21c716eada0fff7350b8592c6a3c68) Thanks [@nickgraynews](https://github.com/nickgraynews)! - Fixes site SEO settings `googleVerification` and `bingVerification` not being emitted into `<head>`. The fields were stored in the database and editable in the admin UI but were never rendered as `<meta name="google-site-verification">` or `<meta name="msvalidate.01">` tags, making meta-tag verification with Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools impossible. EmDashHead now loads site SEO settings and renders these tags on every page.

- [#659](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/659) [`0896ec8`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0896ec81065da7fa9b93053d366500805602c8fe) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Two query-count reductions on the request hot path:
  - **Widget areas now fetch in a single query.** `getWidgetArea(name)` used to do two round-trips — one for the area, one for its widgets. Single left-join now. Saves one query per `<WidgetArea>` rendered on a page.
  - **Dropped the "has any bylines / has any term assignments" probes.** Those fired on every hydration call to save a single query on sites with zero bylines/terms — exactly the wrong tradeoff. The batch hydration queries already handle empty sites at the same cost, so the probes are removed. Pre-migration databases (tables not created yet) are still handled via an `isMissingTableError` catch. Saves two queries per render on pages that hydrate bylines and taxonomy terms.

  On the fixture post-detail page: SQLite `/posts/[slug]` drops from 34 → 32, D1 from 43 → 39. The widget-area JOIN shaves one off every page that renders a widget area.

  `invalidateBylineCache()` and `invalidateTermCache()` are preserved as no-op exports so callers don't break.

The underlying repository already supports these filters — this PR only exposes them through the plugin-facing type.

- [#551](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/551) [`598026c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/598026c99083325c281b9e7ab87e9724e11f2c8d) Thanks [@ophirbucai](https://github.com/ophirbucai)! - Adds RTL (right-to-left) language support infrastructure. Enables proper text direction for RTL languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, and Urdu. Includes LocaleDirectionProvider component that syncs HTML dir/lang attributes with Kumo's DirectionProvider for automatic layout mirroring when locale changes.

Links are sanitized via `sanitizeHref()`. Table styles now use CSS custom properties with fallbacks.

Follow-up to #536 — plugins that build i18n URLs from content records need the locale to pick the right URL prefix, otherwise multilingual content is emitted at default-locale URLs.

- [#523](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/523) [`5d9120e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5d9120eca846dd7c446d05f1b9c14fe1b7e394ec) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Add `nlweb` to the allowed `rel` values for `page:metadata` link contributions, letting plugins inject `<link rel="nlweb" href="...">` tags for agent/conversational endpoint discovery.

The endpoint at `/_emdash/api/mcp` requires bearer token auth, so it has no effect unless a client is configured. Set `mcp: false` to disable.

  Fixes MCP server crash ("exports is not defined") on Cloudflare in dev mode by pre-bundling the MCP SDK's CJS dependencies for workerd.

When a user blurred a field and immediately clicked Publish, the in-flight save PUT could arrive at the server after the publish POST, causing the stale revision to be promoted silently. Introduces `pendingSavePromise` so `publish()` chains onto the pending save rather than firing immediately.

  variables (`S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
  `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_PUBLIC_URL`). Any field omitted from
  `s3({...})` is read from the matching env var on Node at runtime, so
  container images can be built once and receive credentials at boot without a
  rebuild. Explicit values in `s3({...})` still take precedence.

  `s3()` with no arguments is now valid for fully env-driven deployments.
  `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` are now optional in `S3StorageConfig`
  (both or neither). Workers users should continue passing explicit values to
  `s3({...})`.

### Patch Changes

- [#492](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/492) [`13f5ff5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/13f5ff57ffbe89e330d55b3c9c25a1907bf94394) Thanks [@UpperM](https://github.com/UpperM)! - Fixes manifest version being hardcoded to "0.1.0".

### Minor Changes

- [#367](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/367) [`8f44ec2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8f44ec23a4b23f636f9689c075d29edfa4962c7c) Thanks [@ttmx](https://github.com/ttmx)! - Adds `content:afterPublish` and `content:afterUnpublish` plugin hooks, fired after content is published or unpublished. Both are fire-and-forget notifications requiring `read:content` capability, supporting trusted and sandboxed plugins.

- [#431](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/431) [`7ee7d95`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7ee7d95ee32df2b1915144030569382fe97aef3d) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Per-collection sitemaps with sitemap index and lastmod

  `/sitemap.xml` now serves a `<sitemapindex>` with one child sitemap per SEO-enabled collection. Each collection's sitemap is at `/sitemap-{collection}.xml` with `<lastmod>` on both index entries and individual URLs. Uses the collection's `url_pattern` for correct URL building.

- [#414](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/414) [`4d4ac53`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4d4ac536eeb664b7d0ca9f1895a51960a47ecafe) Thanks [@jdevalk](https://github.com/jdevalk)! - Adds `breadcrumbs?: BreadcrumbItem[]` to `PublicPageContext` so themes can publish a breadcrumb trail as part of the page context, and SEO plugins (or any other `page:metadata` consumer) can read it without having to invent their own per-theme override mechanism. `BreadcrumbItem` is also exported from the `emdash` package root. The field is optional and non-breaking — existing themes and plugins work unchanged, and consumers can adopt it incrementally. Empty array (`breadcrumbs: []`) is an explicit opt-out signal (e.g. for homepages); `undefined` means "no opinion, fall back to consumer's own derivation".

- [#111](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/111) [`87b0439`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/87b0439927454a275833992de4244678b47b9aa3) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Adds repeater field type for structured repeating data

- [#382](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/382) [`befaeec`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/befaeecfefd968d14693e96e3cdaa691ffabe7d3) Thanks [@UpperM](https://github.com/UpperM)! - Adds `siteUrl` config option to fix reverse-proxy origin mismatch. Replaces `passkeyPublicOrigin` with a single setting that covers all origin-dependent features: passkeys, CSRF, OAuth, auth redirects, MCP discovery, snapshots, sitemap, robots.txt, and JSON-LD.

  Supports `EMDASH_SITE_URL` / `SITE_URL` environment variables for container deployments where the domain is only known at runtime.

  Disables Astro's `security.checkOrigin` (EmDash's own CSRF layer handles origin validation with dual-origin support and runtime siteUrl resolution). When `siteUrl` is set in config, also sets `security.allowedDomains` so `Astro.url` reflects the public origin in templates.

  **Breaking:** `passkeyPublicOrigin` is removed. Rename to `siteUrl` in your `astro.config.mjs`.

- [#148](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/148) [`1989e8b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1989e8b4c432a05d022baf2196dec2680b2e2fd0) Thanks [@masonjames](https://github.com/masonjames)! - Adds public plugin settings helpers.

Fixes external content images (e.g. from migration or external hosting) being blocked in the content editor.

- [#72](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/72) [`724191c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/724191cf96d5d79b22528a167de8c45146fb0746) Thanks [@travisbreaks](https://github.com/travisbreaks)! - Fix CLI login against remote Cloudflare-deployed instances by unwrapping API response envelope and adding admin scope

- [#480](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/480) [`ed28089`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ed28089bd296e1633ea048c7ca667cb5341f6aa6) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes admin demotion guard, OAuth consent flow, device flow token exchange, preview token scoping, and revision cleanup on permanent delete.

- [#247](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/247) [`a293708`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a2937083f8f74e32ad1b0383d9f22b20e18d7237) Thanks [@NaeemHaque](https://github.com/NaeemHaque)! - Fixes email settings page showing empty by registering the missing API route. Adds error state to the admin UI so fetch failures are visible instead of silently swallowed.

- [#324](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/324) [`c75cc5b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c75cc5b82cb678c5678859b249d545e12be6fd97) Thanks [@barckcode](https://github.com/barckcode)! - Fixes admin editor crash when image blocks lack the `asset` wrapper. Image blocks with `url` at the top level (e.g. from CMS migrations) now render correctly instead of throwing `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'url')`.

- [#353](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/353) [`6ebb797`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6ebb7975be00a4d756cdb56955c88395840e3fec) Thanks [@ilicfilip](https://github.com/ilicfilip)! - fix(core): pass field.options through to admin manifest for plugin field widgets

- [#209](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/209) [`d421ee2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d421ee2cedfe48748148912ac7766fd841757dd6) Thanks [@JonahFoster](https://github.com/JonahFoster)! - Fixes base OG, Twitter, and article JSON-LD titles so they can use a page-specific title without including the site name suffix from the document title.

- [#394](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/394) [`391caf4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/391caf4a0f404f323b97c5d7f54f4a4d96aef349) Thanks [@datienzalopez](https://github.com/datienzalopez)! - Fixes `plugin:activate` and `plugin:deactivate` hooks not being called when enabling or disabling a plugin via the admin UI or `setPluginStatus`. Previously, `setPluginStatus` rebuilt the hook pipeline but never invoked the lifecycle hooks. Now `plugin:activate` fires after the pipeline is rebuilt with the plugin included, and `plugin:deactivate` fires on the current pipeline before the plugin is removed.

- [#357](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/357) [`6474dae`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6474daee29b6d0be289c995755658755d93316b1) Thanks [@Vallhalen](https://github.com/Vallhalen)! - Fix: default adminPages and dashboardWidgets to empty arrays in manifest to prevent admin UI crash when plugins omit these properties.

- [#453](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/453) [`30c9a96`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/30c9a96404e913ea8b3039ef4a5bc70541647eec) Thanks [@all3f0r1](https://github.com/all3f0r1)! - Fixes `ctx.content.create()` and `ctx.content.update()` so plugins can write
  to the core SEO panel. When the input `data` contains a reserved `seo` key,
  it is now extracted and routed to `_emdash_seo` via the SEO repository,
  matching the REST API shape. `ctx.content.get()` and `ctx.content.list()`
  also hydrate the `seo` field on returned items for SEO-enabled collections.

- [#326](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/326) [`122c236`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/122c2364fc4cfc9082f036f9affcee13d9b00511) Thanks [@barckcode](https://github.com/barckcode)! - Fixes WXR import not preserving original post dates or publish status. Uses `wp:post_date_gmt` (UTC) with fallback chain to `pubDate` (RFC 2822) then `wp:post_date` (site-local). Handles the WordPress `0000-00-00 00:00:00` sentinel for unpublished drafts. Sets `published_at` for published posts. Applies to both WXR file upload and plugin-based import paths.

- [#371](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/371) [`5320321`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5320321f5ee1c1f456b1c8c054f2d0232be58ecd) Thanks [@pejmanjohn](https://github.com/pejmanjohn)! - Fix MCP OAuth discovery for unauthenticated POST requests.

- [#338](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/338) [`b712ae3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b712ae3e5d8aec45e4d7a0f20f273795f7122715) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Fixes standalone wildcard "_" in plugin allowedHosts so plugins declaring allowedHosts: ["_"] can make outbound HTTP requests to any host.

- [#434](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/434) [`9cb5a28`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9cb5a28001cc8e6d650ec6b45c9ea091a4e9e3c2) Thanks [@hayatosc](https://github.com/hayatosc)! - Avoid accessing sessions on prerendered public routes.

- [#119](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/119) [`e1014ef`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e1014eff18301ff68ac75d19157d3500ebe890c5) Thanks [@blmyr](https://github.com/blmyr)! - Fix plugin `page:metadata` and `page:fragments` hooks not firing for anonymous public page visitors. The middleware's early-return fast-path for unauthenticated requests now initializes the runtime (skipping only the manifest query), so plugin contributions render via `<EmDashHead>`, `<EmDashBodyStart>`, and `<EmDashBodyEnd>` for all visitors. Also adds `collectPageMetadata` and `collectPageFragments` to the `EmDashHandlers` interface.

- [#424](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/424) [`476cb3a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/476cb3a585d30acb2d4d172f94c5d2b4e5b6377b) Thanks [@csfalcao](https://github.com/csfalcao)! - Fixes public access to the search API (#104). The auth middleware blocked `/_emdash/api/search` before the handler ran, so #107's handler-level change never took effect for anonymous callers. Adds the endpoint to `PUBLIC_API_EXACT` so the shipped `LiveSearch` component works on public sites without credentials. Admin endpoints (`/search/enable`, `/search/rebuild`, `/search/stats`, `/search/suggest`) remain authenticated.

- [#333](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/333) [`dd708b1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/dd708b1c0c35d43761f89a87cba74b3c0ecb777e) Thanks [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn)! - Adds composite index on (deleted_at, published_at DESC, id DESC) to eliminate full table scans for frontend listing queries that order by published_at.

- [#448](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/448) [`c92e7e6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c92e7e6907a575d134a69ebbeed531b99569d599) Thanks [@grexe](https://github.com/grexe)! - fixes logo and favicon site settings not being applied to templates

- [#251](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/251) [`a13c4ec`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a13c4ec6e362abecdae62abe64b1aebebc06aaae) Thanks [@yohaann196](https://github.com/yohaann196)! - fix: expose client_id in device flow discovery response

- [#225](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/225) [`d211452`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d2114523a55021f65ee46e44e11157b06334819e) Thanks [@seslly](https://github.com/seslly)! - Adds `passkeyPublicOrigin` on `emdash()` so WebAuthn `origin` and `rpId` match the browser when dev sits behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy. Validates the value at integration load time and threads it through all passkey-related API routes.

  Updates the admin passkey setup and login flows to detect non-secure origins and explain that passkeys need HTTPS or `http://localhost` rather than implying the browser lacks WebAuthn support.

Previously, `consola.success()` and other log messages leaked into stdout alongside the JSON data, making it unparseable by scripts. Log messages now go to stderr when `--json` is set.

- [#83](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/83) [`38af118`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/38af118ad517fd9aa83064368543bf64bc32c08a) Thanks [@antoineVIVIES](https://github.com/antoineVIVIES)! - Sanitize WordPress post type slugs during import. Fixes crashes when importing sites using plugins (Elementor, WooCommerce, ACF, etc.) that register post types with hyphens, uppercase letters, or other characters invalid in EmDash collection slugs. Reserved collection slugs are prefixed with `wp_` to avoid conflicts.

The middleware now detects an empty database and redirects to the setup wizard instead of letting template helpers query missing tables.

The esbuild dependency pre-bundler was encountering `virtual:emdash/*` imports while crawling dist files and failing to resolve them. These are now excluded from the optimizeDeps scan.
