## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2582](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2582) [`8d8d3de`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8d8d3de006ca8652f0ec9e531dd8be7d851e1a4f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds numbered page navigation and page-size controls to the local Media Library. Media list requests can opt into numbered pages with `page` and receive an exact `totalCount`; cursor pagination remains the default.

  `MediaLibrary` accepts controlled numbered pagination through `pagination`. Existing `hasMore` and `onLoadMore` props remain supported when `pagination` is omitted.

- [#2624](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2624) [`436f63d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/436f63d7f9f8bf43062ccdbbed76b98307b59149) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds focal points for local images so cover-cropped thumbnails, galleries, and image components keep the selected subject visible.

- [#2586](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2586) [`815553c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/815553cbcb3f0263116a1dcde3a039fadd867000) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds flat-folder organization to the local Media Library. Editors can create, rename, and delete folders. Authors can organize their own local media, and editors can organize any local media, through Media Details or by dragging a media card or row onto a visible folder.

  Uploads continue to enter the Main library. Deleting a folder returns its media to the Main library without deleting files or changing their URLs.

- [#2538](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2538) [`9c52b39`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9c52b39fa82f3c13fe9bfbc04d0aa36de4acc219) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds a media usage tracking setting. Tracking is enabled during initial setup. Existing sites enable it from Settings, keep the page open while EmDash scans existing content, and can return later to continue from saved progress.

- [#2470](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2470) [`f527127`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f5271270ea32f8c771016d2b4cdf02cb1a0505e2) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds a coverage-aware Used in section to local media details.

- [#2647](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2647) [`e3ad082`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e3ad0823121704c508cd104783a59fccd3f6a44e) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds signed-label policy and listing-status support to the plugin registry client. Registry requests use the aggregator's required listing policy with an optional accepted-labeler declaration, and withdrawn releases are excluded from install and update results.

  The EmDash admin waits for a fresh listing-policy response before rendering registry metadata, uses the approved author name or publisher DID instead of a mutable handle, and does not request media for an unapproved release. Install, update, and media-proxy checks enforce listing withdrawal independently from the existing plugin-code and capability checks.

  Registry artifact downloads and proxied media connect only to the public IP addresses validated for each URL, preventing DNS changes between validation and connection from reaching private services.

### Patch Changes

- [#2590](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2590) [`724241f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/724241f95f390a09f896a817f4e48aa2883ddbd7) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds a resizable settings panel to the desktop content editor, including keyboard controls and bounded widths.

- [#2468](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2468) [`72664ad`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/72664ad09c230e5b0ba5b55789b5eb118c6b487e) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes vertical alignment of editor sidebar drag handles with standard and collapsible section headings.

- [#2683](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2683) [`3e90689`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3e90689102d02e479c0130dcee520c5209530e94) Thanks [@hossein-webdev](https://github.com/hossein-webdev)! - Fixes AVIF images being rejected with "File type not allowed" on upload. `image/avif` is back in the default media allowlist alongside PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP, so editors can upload `.avif` files again from the media library and from image fields that use the default allowlist.

  The admin file picker now offers `.avif` files and renders their thumbnails, the built-in "Images" preset in a field's allowed-types editor includes AVIF, and `.avif` works as extension shorthand in a field's `allowedMimeTypes`.

  SVG stays excluded from the default allowlist.

- [#2610](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2610) [`2ffda17`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2ffda1737cfbe57c5d10bf57f2b3a48f4d49ae4a) Thanks [@MatsudaTsunenori](https://github.com/MatsudaTsunenori)! - Completes the Japanese admin translation so Japanese-speaking users see localized text for every catalog message.

Clarifies the content type empty-state action.

- [#2490](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2490) [`2b54096`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2b540969f3a73f670c724c17ac59d778d429e055) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes image action controls intermittently failing to appear when selecting an image in the editor.

- [#2632](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2632) [`76dd3eb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/76dd3ebee96ddf53a149d09f98919d43f07fd53a) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes implicit English locale guidance in the content editor by replacing the persistent warning with compact, accessible help.

- [#2599](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2599) [`b383a67`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b383a67b5f4a75d5757f76c4385e9ee83df6f3de) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes code blocks in the admin and inline visual editors so Tab and Shift+Tab indent and outdent code instead of moving focus.

- [#2687](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2687) [`05b0a8b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/05b0a8bb2453d14dd2a65ea22a1e6af6d0a3048b) Thanks [@MatsudaTsunenori](https://github.com/MatsudaTsunenori)! - Fixes newly created taxonomies not appearing in the admin sidebar until the page is reloaded.

- [#2548](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2548) [`1f2678b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1f2678b7a477fdd225d2888f50fa664c85cf9e43) Thanks [@ahliweb](https://github.com/ahliweb)! - Completes the Indonesian admin translations, covering the image gallery block, plugin MCP tool settings, byline filters, content locale settings, and scheduled publishing warnings.

- [#2590](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2590) [`724241f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/724241f95f390a09f896a817f4e48aa2883ddbd7) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Updates the content editor's Move to Trash section to match the other settings surfaces and use a softer destructive button treatment.

- [#2629](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2629) [`52f7c91`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/52f7c91ae9efe2a9b023ea7b6cb739376f8da096) Thanks [@emdashbot](https://github.com/apps/emdashbot)! - Fixes the Section editor so plugin-provided Portable Text blocks appear in the slash menu alongside core blocks, matching the content and widget editors.

- [#2676](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2676) [`7571581`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7571581d598803162f59c6105e23fb0bf29f6520) Thanks [@MatsudaTsunenori](https://github.com/MatsudaTsunenori)! - Fixes the vertical alignment of the Required and Translatable switches in the byline field editor when helper text appears below Translatable.

- [#2468](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2468) [`72664ad`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/72664ad09c230e5b0ba5b55789b5eb118c6b487e) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes the meta description field shifting after the first character is entered.

- [#2463](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2463) [`f613a14`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f613a1470581ad750183ba74ba9562d624db8d88) Thanks [@helio-cf](https://github.com/helio-cf)! - Fixes media previews for streaming providers such as Cloudflare Stream. Video from these providers now shows its poster thumbnail in the media library grid and list, plays in the detail panel instead of stalling at 0:00, and reports the file size the provider supplies. Also exports `Media` from `emdash/ui`, so frontends can render provider-backed video and audio that `Image` cannot.

- [#2628](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2628) [`1c6b893`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1c6b893b40134aeaeedd056594d5bd7b6bfc1a53) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Fixes line breaks entered in table cells disappearing from saved content.

### Minor Changes

- [#2187](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2187) [`6a77862`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6a7786217adee382c92af4cf5e26f3bae6aa0de8) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Add a trusted plugin extension point for contributing isolated, host-framed panels to the saved content editor settings sidebar. Panels support collection and role filtering, deterministic ordering, manifest lifecycle checks, and render-error recovery.

- [#1973](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1973) [`5224b57`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5224b5711ae36f6302e01abdcba586c615a03b16) Thanks [@CacheMeOwside](https://github.com/CacheMeOwside)! - Adds `titleField` and `dateField` optional collection options to choose which field is used as an entry's title and which date the content list shows and sorts by.

- [#2194](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2194) [`2d5fb0b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2d5fb0bccdff34de6935d5cd59bca967a8974dc4) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Adds collection-configured custom field columns to admin content lists. Collection seeds and schema APIs can declare up to four supported fields through `admin.listColumns`; EmDash validates them when building the manifest and renders their stored values between the title and status columns.

- [#2212](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2212) [`fefb702`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fefb702763f2cbd3921124ef3358e7cac3f9dd64) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Adds opt-in database indexes for scalar custom fields and stable cursor pagination when ordering content lists by those fields.

- [#2218](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2218) [`8300c64`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8300c64e8b6004b8895e0886543c24cd91b05225) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Updates media management and selection throughout the admin with clearer asset details, previews, and editing workflows, while keeping stored image metadata consistent across validation and generated types.

- [#2195](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2195) [`4c565ea`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4c565ea7f99d62f423aa0f61e183f3da37dd8925) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Allow trusted React plugins to add manifest-aware, role-filtered content-list columns without taking ownership of the host table, pagination, or row actions.

- [#2505](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2505) [`5828233`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/582823328ea2d205c72e25d3456029a4c49e649d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds native Unicode slugs and requires published entries in routable collections to have a slug. Collections used only for internal or referenced content can set `routable: false` before publishing slugless entries.

### Patch Changes

- [#2512](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2512) [`515c08d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/515c08d17c1a65e3cf93b27a699956fa4c704e56) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds scheduler heartbeat health to the admin dashboard and warns when scheduled content is overdue because maintenance has never run or has stopped running.

- [#2312](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2312) [`a159b44`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a159b445d42465a3ff0f2e9a9d0b18ec51a34e1d) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Adds a byline filter to the admin content list. Pick one or more bylines to see entries credited to any of them, or filter to entries with no byline assigned. Bylines inferred from an entry's author are ignored unless you turn on "Include inferred bylines".

- [#2342](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2342) [`f8a4fce`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f8a4fcefd297da15658b919a4d91109605e8f7b3) Thanks [@fbartolitsch](https://github.com/fbartolitsch)! - Fixes localized taxonomy navigation and editor choices so each admin surface follows the active content locale. Public taxonomy helpers now report visible term counts for the active content locale instead of combining assignments across translations.

- [#2467](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2467) [`7708015`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/77080152dba81a6a4f00a1f9702adffccdaf97f9) Thanks [@eyupcanakman](https://github.com/eyupcanakman)! - Fixes the API token created date showing the wrong day for viewers outside UTC. The timezone-less stored timestamp is now parsed as UTC, matching the other admin dates.

- [#2506](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2506) [`5289385`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/52893854997f8811b729eb22c267dfe8b3ee24ba) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes inline taxonomy term creation for Unicode-only labels and adds numeric suffixes when generated term slugs collide.

- [#1121](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1121) [`592a0e3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/592a0e37c6f53d93f760fcd2d987afa97605f90d) Thanks [@eyupcanakman](https://github.com/eyupcanakman)! - Fixes admin dates showing the wrong time on SQLite-backed sites. Timezone-less stored timestamps in revision history, the dashboard, the content list, the editor's date metadata, and the scheduled publish time are now parsed as UTC, so they no longer drift by the viewer's offset.

- [#2489](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2489) [`13db62c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/13db62c82fbd0fc7b5784e46aa1e03b5c56eeffc) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes file fields to accept persisted media references with incomplete cached metadata while preserving provider data and legacy URLs.

- [#2402](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2402) [`49bc75e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/49bc75efb134d12a27a5f45d2c78fc63894d48eb) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Fixes the editor's word-count footer showing English in every admin language. The word, character, and reading-time metrics now go through the translation catalogs and use each language's plural rules.

- [#2493](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2493) [`2398b8d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2398b8d1bde05f3ffb8b4dc5eb01496e1fc60fda) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes Portable Text editing so content with unsupported marks is blocked with a clear error instead of silently losing those marks.

- [#2491](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2491) [`964f51e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/964f51e5daf70752b4c71e667cb62d15b94c4c27) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes tag suggestions so every matching term is scrollable and selectable with pointer or keyboard navigation.

- [#2510](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2510) [`318b821`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/318b82192773e678a0b02dcf6efd0ee87f665cc3) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Adds Image and HTML insertion to the rich-text toolbar while keeping subscript and superscript in the text-selection menu.

- [#2508](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2508) [`5c216c2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/5c216c2f9253048e55eef676d3438b0eabbb28a7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes localized taxonomy assignments so the editor shows the configured default-locale variant or an unresolved translation prompt instead of hiding the assignment, and identifies the stored content locale and implicit English default.

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2267](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2267) [`e8048e4`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e8048e40b41e57bfaf9bf12faedaca5df3dcfe4e) Thanks [@DavidPivert](https://github.com/DavidPivert)! - Adds an explicit sidebar order for collections. Drag the rows on the Content Types screen, or set `sortOrder` in a seed file, and the admin sidebar follows that order instead of sorting alphabetically by slug. Collections without a `sortOrder` keep the alphabetical order and are listed after the ordered ones, so existing sites look the same until someone reorders. `reorder` is now a reserved collection slug.

- [#2264](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2264) [`741c40c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/741c40cad671ece2fe4fabf69b08b0a3467527ed) Thanks [@DavidPivert](https://github.com/DavidPivert)! - Adds a `hidden` flag to collections that omits their auto-generated entry from the admin sidebar. Hidden collections keep working everywhere else — REST API, MCP, plugin hooks, and their editor at `/_emdash/admin/content/<slug>` — so a plugin that owns a collection end to end can point editors at its own admin UI instead of a raw CRUD list. Set it in a seed file (`"hidden": true`) or via the schema API.

- [#2353](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2353) [`ea4c39b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ea4c39bb184daf35f98eeb32dc9828bceaff77f0) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Adds manual ordering for taxonomy terms. Move terms up and down from the Taxonomies screen, and term listings — `getTerms()` and the terms REST endpoint — return them in that order. The terms attached to a single entry are still listed alphabetically.

  Existing terms keep the order they display in today, now stored explicitly instead of derived from their labels. Terms added afterwards go to the end of their sibling group rather than slotting in alphabetically — if you want a taxonomy alphabetical, order it that way once and it stays.

  A term's position is shared by all of its translations, so ordering a taxonomy in one locale orders it everywhere. On upgrade that means each taxonomy keeps the alphabetical order of the locale its terms were first written in, and other locales are re-sorted to match; reorder once from the Taxonomies screen if you want something different. Sites that need a genuinely different order per language should use separate taxonomies.

  Also fixes moving a term to a new parent only taking effect in the locale you moved it in, which left the term nested in that locale and still at the top level in the others. Moving a term now moves it in every locale, and terms already split this way are repaired on upgrade.

### Patch Changes

- [#2363](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2363) [`6215e93`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6215e93d4fde9529816c0ed0fffc79ecb9a08ec2) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Fixes the publish button not appearing after an autosave on sites without i18n configured. The edit was saved, but the editor kept showing the entry as fully published until a reload.

- [#2366](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2366) [`28b17fd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/28b17fd0fd0e77b177f48c2542e97082658a2aeb) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes silent save failures when creating content in the admin: a rejected create — for example a slug that already exists in the collection — now shows a "Failed to save" toast with the server's message instead of doing nothing.

- [#2258](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2258) [`d9b76be`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d9b76bec4903d8f7185bf79dd348e87f78626e46) Thanks [@thefrana](https://github.com/thefrana)! - Adds Czech (Čeština) to the admin UI. Select it from the language picker on the
  login page or in Settings.

- [#2301](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2301) [`e61cb63`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e61cb63a94efefde7e0b33c3e26d693d1fce9ae7) Thanks [@ankit-fastcurveservices](https://github.com/ankit-fastcurveservices)! - Enables Hindi (हिन्दी) locale in the admin UI

- [#2401](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2401) [`6e47033`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/6e4703300590a9d89237c359448753deb0f978f9) Thanks [@danielmlr](https://github.com/danielmlr)! - Fixes the status badge and status filter labeling published content "Publish" instead of "Published". Existing translations of "Published" now apply there too.

- [#2406](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2406) [`1cf2811`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1cf281131091350865e8e8c89e0bba99e7772314) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the redirects screen so all redirects can be loaded beyond the first 100 results.

- [#2236](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2236) [`2400a3e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2400a3e8943beb77ccf11fa332c6648f95b419cc) Thanks [@bimsonz](https://github.com/bimsonz)! - Shows the derived title and description as placeholders in the SEO panel. `getSeoMeta` already falls back to an entry's own `data.title` and `data.excerpt` when the panel is empty, but the panel gave no sign of it, so empty inputs read as "unset". Editors either retyped the page title into the SEO title or concluded the page had no SEO at all. The SEO Title and Meta Description fields now show the value that will actually be used, so an empty field reads as inheriting it. No change to the generated meta.

- [#1967](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1967) [`f8e41cd`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f8e41cdddae07859b1854719fb15536533916f8b) Thanks [@Rimander](https://github.com/Rimander)! - Makes the Portable Text gallery block editable in the admin editor. Galleries imported from WordPress now load and stay editable instead of being invisible and lost on save, and you can insert new galleries from the toolbar or with /gallery: pick several images at once reorder them by drag and drop, set the column count, and click any image in the gallery to edit its alt text and caption or replace it. Multiple galleries per document are supported, and gallery blocks render on the public site as before.

### Patch Changes

- [#2189](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2189) [`1614e2a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1614e2ad77a467e382fec51fb312e13e26b42d10) Thanks [@leevincent](https://github.com/leevincent)! - Completes the Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) translation of the admin interface.

### Minor Changes

- [#1890](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1890) [`82827d3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/82827d3f8ffdaa4fae688b89cdcc139aa6c25810) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a Backups page to admin settings: download a complete content backup (all content including drafts and trash, schema, taxonomies, menus, widgets, media metadata, and site settings — never user accounts or secrets) with one click, and optionally enable daily automatic backups to the site's storage bucket with configurable retention. A new `backups:manage` permission gates the feature to admins.

- [#1924](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1924) [`1c15097`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1c150977628d729c7b501f24c60a9f65fbb02123) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Redesigns the content editor layout. The editor now fills the viewport with a distraction-lighter writing column, and all publish actions live in a structural settings panel on the end side: a single Save control transitions between Save, Saving, and Saved alongside Live View, Preview, and publish controls in an action bar pinned above the panel's sections. Publish-state badges now live in the Publish section with slug, scheduling, ownership, bylines, translations, taxonomies, SEO, outline, and revisions, with Move to Trash isolated at the bottom. Below the `lg` breakpoint the panel becomes a slide-in sheet behind a Settings button, while Save, preview/live-view access, and publish controls stay visible in the editor header. The layout mirrors correctly in RTL locales.

- [#2013](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2013) [`64b2e73`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/64b2e739949e0f370b4e7b82072c7a99f1baa3cb) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Plugin admin page labels in the sidebar and command palette are now run through the admin's Lingui instance. Plugins that load a message catalog (with the English label as the message id) get localized navigation, and labels matching one of the admin's own messages (such as "Settings") follow the admin locale automatically. Labels without a catalog entry render unchanged.

- [#1868](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1868) [`4c57ee2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/4c57ee216f242ef163ae269ec6ff6abfba716e6f) Thanks [@afonsojramos](https://github.com/afonsojramos)! - Invited users can now accept their invite by signing in with Google or GitHub, instead of only creating a passkey.

- [#2002](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2002) [`e52dea9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e52dea9b72b043d62348f8d01eefade2ce66484c) Thanks [@jcheese1](https://github.com/jcheese1)! - Adds explicitly declared, administrator-enabled plugin MCP tools with per-route permissions, plugin-scoped token access, install and update consent, structured output schemas, and invocation auditing.

- [#1893](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1893) [`d4c565e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d4c565ef99dde5f0a5fafa55b3ca4353dd6d3168) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds the auto-generated admin settings form for plugins that declare `admin.settingsSchema`. A gear icon on the plugin's card in Plugins opens a form generated from the schema (string, number, boolean, select, secret, url, and email fields), persisted to the plugin's KV store under `settings:` keys. Secret fields are write-only: the admin shows whether a value is set but never returns it. Editing plugin settings requires the `plugins:manage` permission.

### Patch Changes

- [#2056](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2056) [`2cb8dd3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2cb8dd3cb6af04e1f0f8dbb825ade372c52cac05) Thanks [@vhscom](https://github.com/vhscom)! - Editor image figcaption no longer falls back to alt text. The editor previously showed alt text below images as if it were a caption, while the published renderer shows only an explicit caption. The editor now mirrors the live output.

- [#2151](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2151) [`f961f6e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/f961f6ec6dcd0bcebc24cffe96705c145f2886af) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Updates admin icons so pages, posts, media, comments, menus, redirects, widgets, sections, taxonomies, bylines, imports, and plugins are easier to distinguish across navigation and related views.

- [#2137](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2137) [`aa7ef09`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/aa7ef096c9ab6628920469fb6a4a75bc9b13395f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Updates admin editor surfaces to use a consistent layered background hierarchy in light and dark mode.

- [#2141](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2141) [`1329cc0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1329cc0ac7e71e06e9626427d2d03dd0375c6fbf) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Aligns the distraction-free editor with the standard editor: consistent width, padding, labels, field surfaces, header alignment, compact action order, and exit placement.

- [#2134](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2134) [`a6b7424`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a6b7424aab4a7016bda15776b26e4f6e3e0fe416) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Fixes duplicate terms in hierarchical taxonomy parent selectors and prevents moving a term beneath its own descendants.

- [#1940](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1940) [`44e2685`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/44e268560d145f2367093f9b4028e9b7f312c7a9) Thanks [@dchaudhari7177](https://github.com/dchaudhari7177)! - Centers the empty-state placeholder labels in Image, File, and media picker fields.

- [#2035](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2035) [`3176f4f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3176f4fff3e93cbe52d49b9c7293aeccefa9e512) Thanks [@mikepage](https://github.com/mikepage)! - Adds Dutch (Nederlands) translations for the admin UI.

- [#2137](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2137) [`aa7ef09`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/aa7ef096c9ab6628920469fb6a4a75bc9b13395f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Improves content editor action alignment and makes forward publishing actions visually consistent across content states, types, and translations.

- [#2137](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2137) [`aa7ef09`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/aa7ef096c9ab6628920469fb6a4a75bc9b13395f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Displays featured image guidance in an instant help tooltip consistent with SEO fields.

- [#2057](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2057) [`a272e58`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a272e58fab994046ba214659328dbf9674fc26ad) Thanks [@mikepage](https://github.com/mikepage)! - Localizes the built-in widget UI in the admin. The core widget labels, descriptions, editor component-select options, and prop-field labels/options (Recent Posts, Categories, Tags, Search, Archives — including fields like "Placeholder text", "Show post count", "Group by") now follow the selected admin language instead of always showing English. Plugin-registered widgets fall back to their server-provided strings.

- [#1902](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1902) [`7ff08db`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7ff08dbea6407b566dd5ea7c159510fd871e01b9) Thanks [@marcusbellamyshaw-cell](https://github.com/marcusbellamyshaw-cell)! - Fixes the login, signup, and invite-accept pages showing the stock EmDash mark and name even when a custom `admin.logo`/`admin.siteName` is configured for white-labeling. These pre-authentication pages now render the configured logo and site name (completing the scope approved in [#639](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/639)/PR [#705](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/705), which wired branding into the sidebar and setup wizard but missed the pages users see before signing in), falling back to the default EmDash mark when no custom branding is configured.

- [#2137](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2137) [`aa7ef09`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/aa7ef096c9ab6628920469fb6a4a75bc9b13395f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Updates the content editor header to scroll with the page on narrower admin layouts.

- [#2114](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2114) [`c80cab6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c80cab66758c97216ca72f278c0eb24c782c96f8) Thanks [@mikepage](https://github.com/mikepage)! - Completes the Dutch (Nederlands) translations for the built-in widget UI labels, descriptions, and prop-field options in the admin.

- [#2160](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2160) [`2da4a40`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2da4a40c7ee57f5c243dceb1bacaf8c2aa985fe5) Thanks [@saariuslystoned](https://github.com/saariuslystoned)! - Fixes plugin block edits being overwritten when saving from the block modal.

- [#2089](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2089) [`b871de2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b871de20c4389514c761b6db8c3c3d36f2a1d991) Thanks [@logelog](https://github.com/logelog)! - Keep byline identity and action controls contained within narrow content editor settings panels.

- [#2120](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2120) [`9c858b1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9c858b1b3387aa174bb8c982609c7ef97d3eb7fa) Thanks [@gornostay25](https://github.com/gornostay25)! - Completes Ukrainian (Українська) translations for the admin UI, including labels, descriptions, dialogs, and form fields.

- [#2109](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2109) [`2da14cc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2da14cc9fff44a761df44114b2f1da273a9a69d1) Thanks [@ahliweb](https://github.com/ahliweb)! - Fixes missing Indonesian admin translations for the latest UI strings.

- [#2137](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2137) [`aa7ef09`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/aa7ef096c9ab6628920469fb6a4a75bc9b13395f) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Aligns the configuration loading screen with the centered EmDash boot experience.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1524](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1524) [`d237e96`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d237e96709cd8685412466c729194649cae18aaf) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds bulk actions to the content list. Select multiple entries with checkboxes (or the header "select all" box) and publish, set to draft, or move them to trash in one step.

### Patch Changes

- [#1865](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1865) [`582ea2c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/582ea2c6d970ff8f7224c46fbe9cf2b7cc2470ef) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes the admin dashboard scheduled-content summary so it counts entries with pending schedules instead of inferring the count from other statuses.

- [#1865](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1865) [`582ea2c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/582ea2c6d970ff8f7224c46fbe9cf2b7cc2470ef) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Updates the admin dashboard and header with more consistent Kumo card styling, aligned loading and error states, and collection quick actions that open new entries directly.

- [#1866](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1866) [`d2f5ddc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d2f5ddc2df8d0d1fd30d3c19ad20baaaa8b6bc49) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Updates admin UI status colors to use Kumo semantic tokens instead of hard-coded palette classes, so email settings, role and comment badges, content type indicators, the dashboard, and other status displays now theme consistently in both light and dark mode. Also fixes warning highlights in the marketplace audit badge and the plugin capability consent dialog, which previously referenced a nonexistent color token and rendered unstyled.

- [#1720](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1720) [`9792226`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9792226e1618735af3726fd949cb89c4e5ba9587) Thanks [@segmentationfaulter](https://github.com/segmentationfaulter)! - Fixes OAuth provider login buttons (Google, GitHub) generating broken URLs on the admin login page. Non-admin `/_emdash/` paths are no longer routed through TanStack Router, which was incorrectly prepending the admin basepath and causing 404s.

- [#1719](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1719) [`7c5de08`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7c5de08f6370ea88500b7ec425d58b2c82443260) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a `taxonomies:read` plugin capability with read-only taxonomy access: plugins that declare it get `ctx.taxonomies` to list taxonomy definitions (`getAll()`), fetch the terms of a taxonomy (`getTerms()`), and read the terms assigned to a content entry (`getEntryTerms()`) — in-process and in both sandbox runners.

- [#1886](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1886) [`60811c0`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/60811c0313096dd485ee9075a0186eb51fc57ca6) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a `toolbar` config option for reliable editor-toolbar delivery behind shared caches. `toolbar: "client"` keeps public HTML identical for every visitor and shows a client-side "Edit" pill for logged-in editors that opens a fresh, uncached editor render via an `_edit` query param; `toolbar: false` disables the toolbar entirely. The toolbar can now also be dismissed in the browser via its × button. The default (`"server"`) is unchanged.

- Updated dependencies [[`7c5de08`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7c5de08f6370ea88500b7ec425d58b2c82443260)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#1849](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1849) [`b36d15c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b36d15c1523dc6e0ada57b4c838f8948b3fbd4fa) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Fixes "Worker exceeded resource limits" when importing large WordPress sites on Cloudflare. The plugin import now runs as a sequence of small requests — content pages, then comments, then menus and site identity — with a live progress bar instead of an indefinite spinner, and media files upload in bounded batches. An interrupted import can safely be re-run: already-imported content is skipped and the import fast-forwards to where it stopped.

- [#1830](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1830) [`15b4d2d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/15b4d2d189142abb69f5c9223c4c1f10363e837f) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Improves WordPress plugin imports: taxonomy terms and assignments (custom post type taxonomies are created as EmDash taxonomies automatically, scoped to the collections they map to), Yoast/Rank Math SEO titles and descriptions, ACF and custom meta fields (suggested as collection fields during analysis and populated on import), navigation menus, and comments (with authors, dates, threading, and approval status) are now imported. Site identity — title, tagline, logo, and favicon — is taken over from the WordPress site, replacing the starter template's placeholders. Internal links in imported content are rewritten to root-relative URLs so they stay on the new site instead of pointing back to the old WordPress domain. Fetches the full media library instead of the first 500 files, supports sites with plain permalinks via a `?rest_route=` fallback, and the import screen accepts a migration key generated by the EmDash Exporter plugin wizard.

### Patch Changes

- [#1848](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1848) [`c1e2c3e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/c1e2c3e5aa17e0ed6f295401f40549353337fd39) Thanks [@dacoto](https://github.com/dacoto)! - Adds a Catalan (ca) locale catalog to the admin UI

Items can now be assigned a parent via the edit dialog, are shown indented under their parent, and reorder buttons move an item relative to its siblings instead of the whole flat list.

- [#1823](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1823) [`fd8ff27`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fd8ff2750530927bb01182d80b61e6c3f1963783) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Updates admin settings success and error feedback to use Kumo toasts across settings pages.

Closes [#1415](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1415).

- [#1673](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1673) [`fe832ce`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fe832ce224b55ea5d83cb5652cc38a8035a574db) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the code block language picker losing focus and closing as soon as you type in it.

Long option lists (for example taxonomy-derived options) are now filterable as you type instead of a plain scrolling dropdown.

The admin's prebuilt stylesheet now matches the design-system version it ships against, so emphasis buttons paint their gradient background correctly.

- [#1633](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1633) [`d063b51`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d063b51e2930c5a1c3bb4d24381afdbdf63a2de2) Thanks [@khoinguyenpham04](https://github.com/khoinguyenpham04)! - Fixes Kumo style loading and updates the admin sidebar to use Kumo's native collapse and theme behavior.

Saving a change now immediately shows the "Publish changes" button, and publishing immediately switches it to "Unpublish" — previously, on sites without i18n configured, both required a manual page refresh. Closes [#1557](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1557).

  `@emdash-cms/admin` uses `@tiptap/extension-drag-handle`, which declares `@tiptap/extension-collaboration`, `@tiptap/y-tiptap` (and transitively `yjs`, `y-protocols`) as peer dependencies. They were never installed because the collaboration feature is unused, and the admin bundle only worked because Rollup silently externalized the unresolved imports.

  Astro 7 switches Vite to Rolldown, which fails the build on unresolved imports instead of externalizing them, so the admin build breaks on this chain. Declaring it fixes the build under Rolldown/Astro 7 — and is correct dependency hygiene regardless of bundler. Closes [#1544](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1544).

- [#1508](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1508) [`e9cd7b7`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e9cd7b7821c5a081257cb56bb857b7950e2b1527) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Add a "Gone (410)" rule type. Redirect rules now support `410` (Content Deleted) and `451` (Unavailable For Legal Reasons) as terminal statuses — served directly with no destination — and the 404 log offers a one-click "Mark as Gone (410)" action next to "Create redirect". A 410 tells search engines a URL was intentionally and permanently removed, so it is deindexed faster than a 404.

### Patch Changes

- [#1521](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1521) [`1b10c1d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1b10c1d64d5975c5fef94e61e8cbff251260184c) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the byline search box still blanking the page while you type. Searching now keeps the current results on screen as the new query loads, instead of collapsing into a full-page loader and dropping the input's focus on each settled keystroke.

### Minor Changes

- [#1427](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1427) [`acfeb89`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/acfeb89060eec29b50cd076b9099bb20d40e7380) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Media details show the file URL with a Copy URL action

  The media library previously exposed no way to obtain a file's URL — the
  detail panel now shows the absolute file URL (relative local-storage paths
  are resolved against the current origin) with a one-click copy button, so
  editors can paste media URLs wherever a URL field is needed.

- [#1425](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1425) [`3e344af`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3e344af2c162e37dfa389b9cb88c2c826590b678) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Repeater fields support `image` sub-fields with the media picker ([#1424](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1424))

  Repeater rows previously rendered every non-scalar sub-field as a plain text
  input, so galleries had to be built from hand-pasted URLs. Image sub-fields
  now render the same media-picker UI as top-level image fields (select,
  preview, change, remove) and store the same MediaValue shape — legacy string
  URLs keep working.

  Includes: `image` in the schema-builder sub-field type select, the shared
  `ImageFieldRenderer` extracted out of `ContentEditor` for reuse, and the
  sub-field type whitelists in core (`REPEATER_SUB_FIELD_TYPES` + the API Zod
  enum) extended — the Zod enum also gains the previously missing `url` entry
  that the builder already offered.

- [#1447](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1447) [`141aa11`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/141aa11213206d9ea5e14d1f1cd75c07cfacae7b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes `@atcute` peer dependency warnings on install ([#1435](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1435))

  Installing EmDash pulled in mismatched `@atcute` package versions, so `pnpm install` / `npm install` reported unmet peer warnings for `@atcute/identity` and `@atcute/lexicons`. The bundled `@atcute` dependencies are now aligned on v2 and installs are clean. If your project also depends on `@atcute` packages directly, note they have moved to v2 (`@atcute/client` 5, `@atcute/lexicons` 2, `@atcute/atproto` 4, `@atcute/oauth-node-client` 2).

The `avatarMediaId` field was already part of the byline model and API but had no admin control, so byline avatars could only be set programmatically, and editing a byline through the UI cleared any avatar that had been set. You can now choose, change, and remove a byline's avatar from the editor.

The media library and the media picker now load small resized thumbnails through Astro's image endpoint instead of fetching every grid item's full-size original, so opening the library and searching for older items no longer waits on full-resolution downloads ([#1488](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1488)). Where no runtime image service is available the original is served as before, so nothing renders worse than it did.

The content editor rendered the published badge as `<Badge variant="primary" className="text-white">`, which produces white text on a light inverted background in dark mode. Use the semantic `variant="success"` (green) instead, which is dark-mode aware and matches the green "published" badge used on the content overview list.

Plugin bundles now declare their access as a structured `declaredAccess` contract that the registry record, the install-consent dialog, and the sandbox all read consistently, so every capability a plugin declares is shown for consent and enforced — no capability is silently dropped. Re-publish affected plugins to adopt the new bundle format; existing installs are unaffected.

The content list API gains `authorId`, `dateField`, `dateFrom`, and `dateTo` query params (all additive and optional), and a new `GET /_emdash/api/content/{collection}/authors` endpoint lists the distinct authors of a collection's content (gated on `content:read`). Filtering runs server-side, so it works across the whole collection rather than only the loaded page.

  Adds `max-h-[85vh] flex flex-col` to the `TermFormDialog` and makes its body
  scrollable with `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`, keeping the header and footer pinned.
  This prevents the Cancel/Update buttons from falling off-screen when the
  Translations panel lists a large number of locales.

The Settings gear opens a plugin at its root (`/plugins/<id>/`), but a plugin that registers its page at `/settings` rather than `/` had no page there, so the admin fell through to a 404. Plugin page resolution now resolves the plugin root to the first registered page and treats `/settings` and `/settings/` as the same path, so a single registration works from the Plugin Manager gear and the sidebar regardless of trailing slash.

- [#1342](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1342) [`83daa41`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/83daa4149ed0d1ccf23d9f90304ef6ba3545d46f) Thanks [@bergaaberg](https://github.com/bergaaberg)! - Adds Norwegian Bokmål (nb) locale to the admin UI.

  Plugin admin pages declared via `adminPages: [{ path, label, icon }]` previously rendered with a hardcoded `PuzzlePiece` glyph — the `icon` field was accepted in the types but never read at runtime. The sidebar now resolves the icon name to its `@phosphor-icons/react` component: common documented names (`settings`, `chart`, `history`, `image`, `trophy`, …) are statically mapped so they resolve synchronously, and any other name is matched against the full Phosphor set by converting it to PascalCase (e.g. `chart-bar` → `ChartBar`) and lazy-loading it from a code-split chunk. The full set is therefore reachable without bundling it into the admin's main chunk. Unknown or omitted names fall back to `PuzzlePiece`, so the change is purely additive.

### Minor Changes

- [#1258](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1258) [`28432b9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/28432b9b5a045c9227d59f7762bf9cb37067a950) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Adds custom fields to bylines. Sites can define site-specific byline metadata (Twitter handle, pronouns, company, localised job title, etc.) via the new `/byline-schema` admin screen, accessed from the **Byline schema** link button at the top of the Bylines admin page (admin-only).

  Per-field `translatable` flag picks whether values are stored per-locale (one value per locale row in a `translation_group`) or shared across every locale variant of the same byline identity. Schema management is gated by `schema:manage`; value editing by `bylines:manage`.

  Custom-field values can be set at both create and update time. `POST` and `PUT` on `/_emdash/api/admin/bylines` accept the same `customFields` map; the row write and the custom-field writes share a single transaction on Node/PG so a partial failure rolls both back. On D1 (no transactions), a retry POST is treated as completing an abandoned create iff three checks all pass: (a) every fixed column on the existing row matches the new payload (`displayName`, `bio`, `avatarMediaId`, `websiteUrl`, `userId`, `isGuest`, effective locale — null-vs-undefined normalised); (b) the existing row's `translationGroup` matches what a fresh create with the same input would produce (`sourceGroup` when `translationOf` is present, `existing.id` when it isn't); (c) every custom-field value already stored on the row appears in the input payload with an equal value (subset-match, so partial mid-loop crashes can be completed). The recovery branch is conservative on every axis: any fixed-column mismatch, any translation-group mismatch, any overlapping custom-field value mismatch, an input that omits a key the existing row stores, or an input with no custom fields at all → standard `CONFLICT`. Validation runs before any DB write so a bad value (unknown slug, type mismatch, select-choice miss, non-URL or non-http(s) URL for a `url` field) returns 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` without leaving partial state behind. In the admin, registered fields render inline with Name, Bio, etc. — no separate section header — and are available in the **New byline** dialog as well as edit.

  `BylineSummary` gains an optional `customFields: Record<string, CustomFieldValue>` property. Existing object-literal consumers stay source-compatible because the property is optional and runtime always returns `{}` when no fields are registered.

  Hydration is symmetric with writes: rows are only applied to a byline when they live in the table matching the field's current `translatable` flag, so stale rows from a `translatable` flip can't leak into hydrated output. Schema mutations on `/byline-schema` invalidate the same `byline-fields` query the byline form reads, so newly-registered fields appear in the editor without a page reload. `url` field values are parsed with `new URL(...)` AND restricted to `http:` / `https:` schemes at write time so they can't ship `javascript:` / `data:` / `mailto:` payloads to link rendering. The `BylineFieldEditor` "Save" button stays disabled until a `select` field has at least one option; and select-option lists are accumulated on a null-prototype object so option values that collide with `Object.prototype` keys render correctly.

  The field-definitions cache uses parity on `options.byline_fields_version` as a dirty bit: schema mutations flip the counter to odd before the write lands and to a **new even** value after, with the cache treating any odd version as "bypass the global holder, read fresh from the DB". `markVersionDirty` is parity-aware (ensures odd, no-op if already odd) so a crashed prior attempt's leftover dirty state can't get inverted. `markVersionClean` is **always-advance** (`+2` when starting even, `+1` when starting odd) so two concurrent mutators can't collapse on the same even key and pin the cache on a partial-set snapshot — every committed mutation produces an observable counter change for cache readers. Idempotent-retry exits (`FIELD_EXISTS` on create, `FIELD_NOT_FOUND` on update/delete, no-op input on update) call `markVersionClean` too, which doubles as both the dirty-crash recovery and the false-clean recovery. All version writes use `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` so a missing options row can't silently turn invalidation into a no-op.

  Implements [#1174](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/discussions/1174). Builds on the bylines-i18n foundation from [#1146](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1146).

The existing `htmlBlock` Portable Text type (produced by the WordPress and Contentful importers) is now a fully editable block in the rich-text editor. Authors can insert an HTML block via the `/html` slash command and edit raw HTML in a textarea. Imported `htmlBlock` content that previously fell through to an opaque `pluginBlock` placeholder is now rendered in the same editable UI. The inline (visual-editing) editor preserves HTML blocks as read-only placeholders to prevent data loss.

- [#1297](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1297) [`cccf4f2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/cccf4f2b40451efa724136e815158ebca189a135) Thanks [@emdashbot](https://github.com/apps/emdashbot)! - Fix content entity editor block menu actions (Duplicate / Delete) not working when the drag handle sets a NodeSelection ([#1261](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1261)).

- [#1225](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1225) [`886f2d1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/886f2d1e4969403787cc39dfbda6dcdfe034372c) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Add search to the byline picker on content entities and remove the effective 100-byline cap. The picker now performs a debounced server-side search via the bylines API instead of rendering a fixed dropdown of the first 100 results, so bylines beyond the first page can be found and credited. Credited bylines from the saved entry are also resolved from the entry itself, so a credit that falls outside the initial list still renders its name instead of disappearing.

- [#1222](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1222) [`a5dafb3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a5dafb32b75358c96be5f2a2487bf323a0045bb8) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Fixes the byline search box reloading the whole page on every keystroke. The search term is now debounced (300ms) before it feeds the bylines query, and the full-page loader only takes over when there is no data yet (`isLoading && !data`) instead of on every new query key. Typing now stays responsive and keeps the input focused, matching the behaviour of the users page. The load-more snapshot and its filter-match check both use the debounced search value so appended pages are no longer discarded.

- [#1226](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1226) [`9422d6a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9422d6a744b17f477a3966c3c7e07a087a3345e6) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Make content list search work on large collections ([#1219](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1219)). The admin content list previously filtered only the rows already loaded on the current page, so an entry far back in a big collection could not be found until you navigated near it. The list endpoint now accepts a `q` parameter and performs a case-insensitive substring search across the collection's title/name/slug columns server-side (LIKE wildcards in the query are escaped), and the admin search box drives that query (debounced) instead of filtering in memory. Also adds locale-aware composite indexes (`idx_{table}_loc_upd` / `idx_{table}_loc_crt`) so locale-filtered content lists stay index-served on large, i18n-enabled tables.

- [#1224](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1224) [`67f5992`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/67f5992aec23d02c724505632ce951e5b7af9cdb) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Fix taxonomy terms not being locale-aware in the content editor ([#1218](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1218)). Term assignments are stored against the per-locale content row while the term's `translation_group` spans every locale, so resolving terms for an entry must scope to the entry's locale. The content terms endpoint (`/content/:collection/:id/terms/:taxonomy`) now derives the entry's locale server-side and passes it to `getTermsForEntry`, and the admin `TaxonomySidebar` threads the entry locale through its fetch/save calls (and into its React Query keys, so switching translations refetches). Previously a localized post showed and applied every locale variant of a tag instead of just the variant for its own locale.

- [#1227](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1227) [`a40e455`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a40e455a8de730a61291798a3fe0ee32dde24ed0) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - Add search and filtering to the media library ([#1221](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1221)). The media list endpoint now accepts a `q` parameter for a case-insensitive filename substring search (which also matches extensions, with LIKE wildcards escaped), alongside the existing `mimeType` filter. The Media Library page gains a filename search box and a type filter (images / video / audio / documents), and the media picker in the content editor now searches the local library by filename too. Previously neither surface could search or filter local media, which made large libraries hard to navigate.

- [#1223](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1223) [`34afc14`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/34afc1448440f8ffab956f096322d67ec42127cb) Thanks [@scottbuscemi](https://github.com/scottbuscemi)! - The rich-text editor formatting toolbar now stays pinned to the top of the editing area while scrolling through long posts, instead of scrolling out of view. The toolbar uses `position: sticky` and the editor wrapper switched from `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-clip` so corners stay clipped without creating a nested scroll container that would break sticky positioning. Distraction-free / minimal editors (e.g. Widgets) are unaffected since they don't render the toolbar.

Map the picker's collection to the correct enum value (`pages` → `page`, `posts` → `post`, everything else → `collection`) so picking a page or post actually adds it to the menu.

Kumo 2.4 moved the sidebar surface to an inner container painted with `bg-(--sidebar-bg)`, where `--sidebar-bg` is resolved from the wrapper's default (light) `--color-kumo-base`. The sidebar's dark-chrome override only set `--color-kumo-base`, which no longer reaches that surface, so the dark background was lost while the white text remained. The override now sets `--sidebar-bg` directly.

A plugin's manifest may set a release-level `requires` block (e.g. `{ "env:emdash": ">=1.0.0", "env:astro": ">=4.16" }`), which is published into the release record. When browsing a registry plugin, the admin compares those constraints against the running EmDash and Astro versions: if the host doesn't satisfy them, it shows a compatibility warning and disables the Install button. The server enforces the same check on install and update, refusing an incompatible release with `ENV_INCOMPATIBLE` so the gate can't be bypassed.

- [#1239](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1239) [`1a4918f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1a4918ff989d57b4f12e44b647542e406dce7cb9) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Plugins published to the experimental registry can now ship icon, screenshot, and banner images. Declare them in `emdash-plugin.jsonc` under `release.artifacts` as file refs; `emdash-plugin publish --artifact-base-url <url>` measures each image's dimensions, uploads it, and records it in the release. The admin plugin detail page renders the icon, banner, and a screenshot gallery, fetched through a server-side image proxy. The proxy resolves each artifact's URL server-side from the validated release record (the client sends only the artifact's coordinates, never a URL), then applies SSRF defences and an image content-type allowlist before serving the bytes. Supported image types are PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, and AVIF; SVG is rejected at both publish and proxy because it is active content.

Publishers' `description`, `installation`, `faq`, `changelog`, and `security` sections render as sanitized Markdown (the shared audited `renderMarkdown` — raw HTML, scripts, and images stripped, https-only links) in a tabbed view below the install action, with one tab per non-empty section. The page also shows an SBOM badge with the document format and a guarded direct download link (rendered only for safe http(s) URLs), the publisher-asserted `lastUpdated` time labelled distinctly from the aggregator's `indexedAt`, and an accessible tooltip on the verified-publisher shield naming the labeller DID that issued the verification.

### Minor Changes

- [#1146](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1146) [`11b3001`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/11b300100e066c6b3463070a9b65fba868f37e9b) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Adds first-class i18n support for bylines, mirroring the row-per-locale model already used by menus and taxonomies (PR #916, migrations 036).

  ## Schema (migration 040)

  `_emdash_bylines` gains two columns:
  - `locale` — `TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'en'`. Every row now belongs to exactly one locale.
  - `translation_group` — `TEXT NOT NULL`. Shared across every locale variant of a single byline identity. The anchor row's `translation_group` equals its `id`; siblings inherit it.

  A partial unique index `idx_bylines_group_locale_unique` enforces one row per `(translation_group, locale)`. The pre-existing `(slug)` unique index becomes `(slug, locale)` to allow the same slug across locales.

  Existing rows are backfilled to the configured `defaultLocale` (or `'en'` if i18n isn't configured) with `translation_group = id`. Monolingual sites see no functional change; multilingual sites continue rendering the same byline data at the default locale until editors create translations.

  ## Credit hydration: strict per-locale

  `_emdash_content_bylines.byline_id` now stores the byline's `translation_group`, not its row id. When an entry is rendered, credits are filtered by joining the junction against the byline sibling whose `locale` matches the entry's `locale`. If no sibling exists at the entry's locale, the credit hydrates as empty — there is **no fallback** to other locales' bios.

  Author-inferred bylines (where an entry has no explicit credits but its author is linked to a byline) still fall back per-locale and respect the strictness gate: an entry with explicit credits at any locale will not infer from the author even if the explicit credits don't resolve at the rendering locale.

  This is a deliberate behavior change for multilingual sites. The motivation is correctness: chain-walking credits across locales renders the wrong-language bio on translated entries.

  The "explicit credit suppresses author fallback" check reads `primary_byline_id` directly from the content row — set by `setContentBylines` iff junction rows exist, backfilled by migration 040 for pre-existing rows. No separate probe against `_emdash_content_bylines` is needed at hydration time; the column is folded into the single per-entry context fetch (`author_id` + `primary_byline_id` in one query). Both monolingual and multilingual sites get the same query count.

  ## Identity lookups: chain-walk

  `getBylineBySlug(slug, { locale })` walks the configured fallback chain (`resolveLocaleChain`), like `getMenu` and `getTerm`. Author pages for un-translated bylines still render an identity rather than 404'ing. This is conceptually distinct from credit hydration and runs through `requestCached` for per-render dedupe.

  ## Admin
  - **TranslationsPanel** in the bylines editor lists every configured locale with Edit / Translate buttons. The Translate action POSTs to the new `POST /_emdash/api/admin/bylines/:id/translations` endpoint.
  - **LocaleSwitcher** on `/bylines` filters the list strictly to one locale. Cross-locale navigation via TranslationsPanel routes through `/bylines?locale=…`.
  - The **byline picker** on the content editor is locale-pinned to the entry's locale. Editors only see bylines that will actually hydrate at the entry's locale.
  - The **byline credit empty state** on a locale with no bylines yet shows a CTA linking to `/bylines?locale=…` for inline creation.
  - Translating an entry (`POST /content/:collection` with `translationOf`) calls `copyContentBylines` to inherit the source's credits — these resolve at the new entry's locale via the strict-hydration model, so credits "follow" the content across translations once sibling bylines exist.

  ## API additions
  - `GET /_emdash/api/admin/bylines/:id/translations` — list every sibling row sharing a translation_group.
  - `POST /_emdash/api/admin/bylines/:id/translations` — create a sibling at a target locale. Body defaults (slug, displayName, websiteUrl, avatar) inherit from the source.
  - `POST /_emdash/api/admin/bylines` accepts `translationOf` + `locale` to create a sibling in one call.
  - `GET /_emdash/api/admin/bylines?locale=…` filters strictly.
  - `BylineSummary` gains `locale: string` and `translationGroup: string | null` (additive — existing consumers ignore the new fields).

  ## Permissions

  Two new entries on `@emdash-cms/auth`:
  - `bylines:read` — minimum `SUBSCRIBER`.
  - `bylines:manage` — minimum `EDITOR`.

  All byline routes (list, get, update, delete, translations) now check these instead of `content:read` / `Role.EDITOR`. Role thresholds are unchanged, so existing users see no permission differences. Custom RBAC configurations that bind to the old strings should add the new permission names.

  ## Repository
  - `BylineRepository` is strict per-locale: `findMany`, `findBySlug`, `findById` accept an optional `locale` and return rows matching that locale (or all locales when omitted, for the manager view).
  - New methods: `listTranslations(id)`, `findByTranslationGroup(group)`, `copyContentBylines(collection, fromId, toId)`.
  - `setContentBylines` deduplicates by `translation_group` after resolving wire row ids, so passing two sibling row ids of the same identity collapses to one credit row.
  - `delete` is sibling-aware: removing one locale variant leaves siblings standing.

  ## Notable trade-offs
  - **Strict hydration over chain-walking** for credits. Chain-walking would render mismatched-language bios on translated content. The honest answer is to show nothing rather than the wrong thing; the picker tells editors which bylines will resolve at the entry's locale, and the empty-state CTA makes creating a sibling a one-click flow.
  - **Schema is row-per-locale**, not a separate `byline_translations` side-table. Matches the existing content / menu / taxonomy convention so query patterns and indexes are consistent across the codebase.

- [#1176](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1176) [`fae97ee`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fae97ee5465934365864557e9fa3ee8754cfd49c) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Code blocks in the rich text editor now have an inline language picker. Hover over any code block to reveal a chip in the corner; click it to enter a language (free-form input with curated suggestions for ~30 common languages including TypeScript, Python, Bash, Rust, Astro, SQL, and more). Aliases resolve automatically -- typing `ts` stores `typescript`, `c++` stores `cpp`, etc. The existing markdown shortcut (typing ` ```html ` followed by a space or Enter) continues to pre-populate the language. The chosen language persists on the Portable Text `language` field and is emitted as a `language-{id}` class on the rendered `<pre>` so frontend syntax highlighters can pick it up. The visual (in-place) editor gets the same picker UI.

- [#1114](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1114) [`9a30607`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9a30607791a2f27473b1d2fe7700291e0be1ea1c) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Plugins installed from the experimental registry can now be uninstalled and updated from the admin, the same way marketplace plugins always could. The "uninstall is not yet available for registry plugins" placeholder is gone — registry plugin rows now show the same Uninstall and Update buttons.

  The Plugins page's "updates available" indicator now covers registry plugins too. If the registry aggregator is unreachable, marketplace updates still load (and vice versa).

  Updates that need newly-declared permissions, or that newly expose a public (unauthenticated) route, prompt for re-consent before installing the new version — matching the gate that marketplace updates already have.

- [#1125](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1125) [`d0ff94b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d0ff94bd476e7fd4b5d18c94904cfb5c071fea92) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds a version picker to the registry plugin detail page. Older releases of a registry-hosted plugin are now selectable from a dropdown next to the Install button, and the displayed version, indexed date, permissions, and source link swap to match the selected release. Pre-release versions (e.g. `1.0.0-alpha.1`) are flagged with a "Pre-release" badge so admins can spot them before installing. Versions still inside the configured minimum-release-age holdback remain visible in the dropdown but stay non-installable until they age into the window.

### Patch Changes

- [#1177](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1177) [`b9cc08e`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b9cc08e7556ccdbcbbcea6d3c06cae6abef18766) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Bumps `@cloudflare/kumo` from 1.16 to 2.3. Two internal call sites picked up breaking API changes from Kumo 2.0: `Collapsible` is now a compound component (`Collapsible.Root` / `.DefaultTrigger` / `.DefaultPanel` instead of `<Collapsible label=...>`), used by the accordion block; and `ChartPalette.color()` was renamed to `ChartPalette.categorical()` in the chart block. No public API changes -- consumers see identical behaviour. Tests in `@emdash-cms/admin` that asserted on `Button`'s native `title` attribute now read `aria-label` instead, because Kumo 2 wraps `<Button title>` in a Tooltip popup rather than setting the DOM attribute.

- [#1119](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1119) [`393dd26`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/393dd26fd4e6fc38ed2584cbb5f29d5f69fb1dad) Thanks [@adentdk](https://github.com/adentdk)! - Fixes auto-save not detecting plugin block field changes. When editing an existing block's attributes via the Block Kit modal, the change now correctly triggers TipTap's `onUpdate` callback, propagating through to the auto-save dirty detection.

The plugin detail page now shows the license (linked to spdx.org for single SPDX identifiers), keywords, all authors, all security contacts, and a link to the source repository. The browse cards show the license alongside the description.

### Minor Changes

- [#1052](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1052) [`0d5843f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0d5843fc3378936667ab81c56001349198028ebb) Thanks [@Rimander](https://github.com/Rimander)! - Fixes menu REST API consistency:
  - **`POST /menus/:name/items` no longer accepts unknown keys silently.** Sending `custom_url` (snake_case) or `url` used to return 201 with `custom_url: null` because Zod's default `.strip()` quietly dropped them. The schemas now use `.strict()` and return **400 `VALIDATION_ERROR`** with `Unrecognized key: "custom_url"`. The documented camelCase keys (`customUrl`, `sortOrder`, `referenceCollection`, etc.) are unchanged and persist as before. The `type` field is now validated against the canonical enum (`"custom" | "page" | "post" | "taxonomy" | "collection"`); previously any string passed.
  - **Moves per-item writes to `PUT` and `DELETE /menus/:name/items/:id` (path-style).** Every other EmDash resource (`content`, `taxonomies`, `redirects`, `sections`, `widget-areas`) addresses items by URL path; menus were the lone outlier requiring `?id=<id>` in the query string. The legacy query-string form is **removed** (it was undocumented and only used by the admin, which is updated in this PR). Callers should use `PUT /menus/:name/items/:id` / `DELETE /menus/:name/items/:id`.
  - **Menu and menu-item API responses are now camelCase**, aligning with the rest of EmDash's REST surface (`content`, `taxonomies`, `redirects`, …). `created_at` → `createdAt`, `updated_at` → `updatedAt`, `menu_id` → `menuId`, `parent_id` → `parentId`, `sort_order` → `sortOrder`, `reference_collection` → `referenceCollection`, `reference_id` → `referenceId`, `custom_url` → `customUrl`, `title_attr` → `titleAttr`, `css_classes` → `cssClasses`, `translation_group` → `translationGroup`. **Breaking** for direct REST consumers that depend on snake_case keys in the response body. The admin UI is already updated.
  - **Refactors menus to the standard repository pattern.** Adds `MenuRepository` next to `ContentRepository`, `TaxonomyRepository`, `RedirectRepository`, `MediaRepository`, `CommentRepository`. Handlers become thin orchestrators; the repository is now the single place where snake_case rows become camelCase entities.

  These changes do not touch any database schema or migration. Existing data is preserved.

- [#1011](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1011) [`dbaea9c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/dbaea9ccaef6ac48dda14b77c6b2adbe0dc0ff38) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds experimental support for the decentralized plugin registry (see RFC #694). Configure with `experimental.registry.aggregatorUrl` in `astro.config.mjs`; the admin UI then uses the registry instead of the centralized marketplace for browse and install. Marketplace behavior is unchanged when the option is not set.

  The experimental config accepts a `policy.minimumReleaseAge` duration (e.g. `"48h"`) that holds back releases below that age from install and update prompts, with a `policy.minimumReleaseAgeExclude` allowlist for trusted publishers or specific packages. The minimum-release-age check is enforced both client-side (for UX) and server-side (in the install endpoint), so stale browser tabs and deep links still hit the gate.

### Patch Changes

- [#751](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/751) [`05440b1`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/05440b11ef5df609ad7f800143fa96019da22101) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fix the admin collection list pagination denominator so it no longer grows in increments of 5 as the user pages forward.

  The `GET /_emdash/api/content/{collection}` response now includes a `total` field with the full filtered row count (independent of `limit`). The admin uses it as the pagination denominator, so a 143-entry collection reads `1/8` on page 1 instead of `1/5 → 5/10 → 10/15 → …` as successive API pages load.

  The `total` field is optional; pre-upgrade clients that ignore it still work, and the admin falls back to the loaded-item count when an older server doesn't return it.

  Also handles the edge case where the current page exceeds `totalPages` after filtering or deletion — the admin clamps the active page so the table doesn't render empty while waiting for a refetch.

- [#1050](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1050) [`484e7ab`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/484e7ab66a9d7910bcb56b3385babb28a8ff0986) Thanks [@wojtekpiskorz](https://github.com/wojtekpiskorz)! - Fixes broken image collapsing media picker container — adds `onError` handler and fallback placeholder so Change/Remove buttons remain accessible when referenced image is missing from storage

- [#1013](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1013) [`0cd8c6d`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0cd8c6d4e0f0dc126d66f953afcfdc3d6201d00b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the slash command menu's initial selection getting overridden when the menu opens under a stationary pointer. The menu items previously reacted to `mouseenter` unconditionally, so an item rendered beneath the cursor would steal selection from the keyboard default before any user interaction. Mouse-hover-selects still works, but only after the user actually moves the pointer over the menu.

- [#1020](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1020) [`d014b48`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d014b483e438a52fb27fcfa47ed6ef64a24e21df) Thanks [@ahliweb](https://github.com/ahliweb)! - Adds missing Indonesian (id) translations for SEO settings labels and replaces "Edit" with "Sunting" and "Tagline" with "Slogan" across the admin UI.

### Minor Changes

- [#997](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/997) [`7b45cba`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7b45cba66143c3a75bbd880abff85303c1fd6072) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds support for a site-wide default Open Graph image. The setting is exposed in the admin SEO settings page (Settings -> SEO -> Default Social Image), resolved to a URL on read by `getSiteSettings()`, and automatically emitted as `og:image` / `twitter:image` (and BlogPosting JSON-LD `image`) by `EmDashHead.astro` whenever a page has no image of its own. Per-page images still take precedence.

  This wires up an existing data model that was previously defined in the schema and MCP tools but never used: stored values were not resolved and no template path read the setting.

  Emitted URLs are absolutized using `SiteSettings.url`, the page's `siteUrl`, or the request origin so crawlers and JSON-LD consumers that reject relative URLs work correctly.

  Also adds a `localOnly` prop to `MediaPickerModal` that suppresses the "Insert from URL" input and external provider tabs. Used by SEO settings to ensure the picker only returns locally-stored media (since the setting only persists a local `mediaId`).

  Media metadata updates and deletes now invalidate the worker-scoped site-settings cache, so resolved logo/favicon/default-social-image URLs and dimensions stay in sync with the underlying media row.

### Patch Changes

- [#996](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/996) [`19576be`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/19576be43134359596ca7705f84fd645bd2f3824) Thanks [@r2sake](https://github.com/r2sake)! - Fix media library admin page and the media picker modal (used by the rich text editor and image fields when embedding media into content) to support libraries larger than 50 items by wiring up cursor-based infinite scroll (mirrors the content list fix from #135)

- [#1004](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1004) [`35791ff`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/35791ff9f68c10c6d3ff15ee0ab407baef09c2aa) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes a stale ref race in the slash command menu's keyboard handlers. The state ref was synced via `useEffect` (post-commit), so TipTap's Suggestion plugin could read stale state when invoking `onKeyDown` synchronously -- causing Enter to occasionally fail to execute commands and arrow navigation to skip selections on slower runs.

### Minor Changes

- [#942](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/942) [`7c536e5`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7c536e59b005a79925dd0ecab46404d9d34196b8) Thanks [@MA2153](https://github.com/MA2153)! - Adds per-field allowed MIME types for `file` and `image` fields. Field-level `allowedTypes` is now honored end-to-end: it filters the media picker, widens upload acceptance for that field (so e.g. a zip-only field can accept zip uploads even though the global allowlist excludes them), and validates referenced media against the destination field on content save. The schema editor in admin gains an "Allowed types" control with curated presets and freeform entry.

  Behavior change: the `image` builder's `allowedTypes` option was previously accepted but read by nothing. It is now load-bearing — a code-first schema that already passed `allowedTypes` (e.g. `["image/png"]`) will now actually narrow the picker and gate uploads. Most users will see no change; if you set this option intending the old (silent) behavior, drop it.

  Behavior change: updating a field via the admin schema editor now explicitly clears its validation when the form contains no validation settings, instead of leaving an existing `validation` value intact. This only affects fields with pre-existing validation that is not expressible in the editor UI.

Users can now insert and edit tables via the slash command menu (/table) or toolbar button. Tables support header rows, column/row insertion and deletion, and include a bubble menu for quick editing.

- [#958](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/958) [`7f6b6ea`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7f6b6ead417f3b495843a4da5653531cf735aae4) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes admin lists, tables and info cards rendering as transparent against the page background. Card containers in the content list, content type list, content type editor, media library, comments, users and device authorization views now have an explicit `bg-kumo-base` surface so they're visually distinct from the body.

  Also fixes column header labels in content list tables ("Title", "Status", etc.) rendering pale because of an undefined Tailwind class (`text-kumo-fg`) -- they now use the default text color and rely on the sort indicator icon to signal active state.

- [#952](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/952) [`131bea6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/131bea68b7f580e353716a1a1934f2a6fec3b3e7) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Replaces 20 raw `<input type="checkbox">` elements across the admin UI with Kumo's `Switch` and `Checkbox` components. Single-boolean toggles (SEO, Enable comments, Required, etc.) become `Switch`; multi-select / list-context checkboxes (collection multi-select, term tree nodes) become `Checkbox`. Drops manual styling and label markup that duplicated what the Kumo components provide built-in.

Standardises on Kumo's `Button` `icon` prop and `LinkButton` (with `external` for new-tab links) instead of manual icon spacing and raw anchor styling, removes a `<Link><Button>` invalid HTML nesting in the plugin manager, and translates two stray English strings in the user list empty state.

Introduces a `RouterLinkButton` component that wraps TanStack Router's `<Link>` with Kumo button styling (`variant`, `size`, `shape`, `icon` props), and migrates all existing `<Link className={buttonVariants(...)}>` usages to use it. Extracts the duplicated "Back to settings" header link into a shared `BackToSettingsLink` component.

After this PR, EmDash admin UI is fully localizable across all known surfaces.

- [#957](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/957) [`13ff061`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/13ff061517ede4b29608de0120283914b43e6b76) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the OG image picker in the content editor only appearing for collections with a field literally named `featured_image`. The OG image control now lives in the SEO sidebar panel alongside the other SEO fields, so any collection with `seo` enabled can set a social preview image regardless of whether it has a featured image field.

- [#955](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/955) [`49b66d9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/49b66d910c80b87b2632ad34e923695c9a302a05) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Removes the sticky editor header from content / content-type / section / settings pages. The sticky implementation had transparency artifacts (backdrop-blur over varied content), layout fragility (negative margins canceling parent padding), z-index conflicts with the app bar, and ~85px of permanent vertical chrome. Each editor now renders a Save button at the bottom of the form so users can save without scrolling back to the top header. The distraction-free hover-overlay header in the content editor is preserved.

All `title=`, `aria-label=`, `placeholder=`, and toast messages in these areas now flow through Lingui.

This gives consistent styling, proper focus rings, accessibility (label association via the Field wrapper), and dark-mode handling for free instead of relying on hand-rolled Tailwind classes that bypassed the design system.

### Patch Changes

- [#719](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/719) [`2e2b8e9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/2e2b8e90c099f3422808f0e1da9c83a9ec533b64) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes the `file` field type rendering as a plain text input in the content editor. Adds a `FileFieldRenderer` that opens the media picker (with mime filter disabled) so any file type can be attached. Also adds a `hideUrlInput` prop to `MediaPickerModal` so non-image pickers can hide the image-specific "Insert from URL" input.

  Aligns the Zod schema and generated TypeScript types for `image` and `file` fields with the shape the admin actually stores: `provider?`, `meta?` (for both), and `previewUrl?` (for image). Previously these fields were stripped on validation and missing from generated types, so site code could not reliably resolve local media URLs from `meta.storageKey`.

### Minor Changes

- [#731](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/731) [`9dfc65c`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/9dfc65c42c04c41088e0c8f5a8ca4347643e2fea) Thanks [@drudge](https://github.com/drudge)! - Adds a `media_picker` Block Kit element: a thumbnail preview with a modal library picker and mime-type filter. Usable in plugin block forms and in Block Kit field widgets. The stored value is the selected asset's URL string, so it is value-compatible with a plain `text_input` — existing content continues to work after swapping. The `mime_type_filter` is restricted to image MIME types (`image/` or `image/<subtype>`); wildcards and non-image types are rejected.

- [#809](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/809) [`e7df21f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e7df21f0adca795cdb233d6e64cd543ead7e2347) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds an optional `category` field to `PortableTextBlockConfig` for plugin-contributed block types. Plugins can now choose how their blocks are grouped in the admin slash menu (e.g. "Sections", "Marketing", "Media", "Layout") instead of always falling under "Embeds". Existing plugins that omit the field continue to render under "Embeds" exactly as before.

- [#814](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/814) [`a838000`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/a83800068678daf6391e02bba8acf27ff4db0e19) Thanks [@arashackdev](https://github.com/arashackdev)! - rtl srtyle improvements and LTR/RTL compatible arrow/caret icons

- [#854](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/854) [`491aeec`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/491aeec5a66e2f764eb9d8ed8425e9d402ada4a7) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Adds consistently-placed sticky Save buttons across editor pages so unsaved changes are always visible. The Content editor, Section editor, Content Type editor, and Settings sub-pages (General, SEO, Social Links) now render their primary save action in a sticky top-right header that stays visible while users scroll long forms. The existing bottom-of-form save buttons are preserved so keyboard and screen-reader users still hit a save action as the last interactive control on the page (DOM order is unchanged). Introduces a shared `EditorHeader` component for editor pages that want the same sticky-header pattern. Fixes #233.

### Patch Changes

- [#849](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/849) [`d6754ae`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d6754ae7746b0f9035d2c5e390ece7199762b094) Thanks [@drudge](https://github.com/drudge)! - Fixes the `datetime` field widget so existing values display in the editor and new values pass server validation. The widget passed raw ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`) into `<input type="datetime-local">`, which silently rendered empty, and emitted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` on save, which the field's zod schema rejected. Strips the suffix for display, appends `:00.000Z` on save, and normalizes date-only stored values to UTC midnight for the input. Applies to the top-level `datetime` widget in the content editor and the `datetime` sub-field type inside `RepeaterField`.

- [#702](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/702) [`0ee372a`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0ee372a7f33eecce7d90e12624923d2d9c132adf) Thanks [@ilicfilip](https://github.com/ilicfilip)! - Adds `@emdash-cms/plugin-field-kit` — composable field widgets for `json` fields. Four widgets (`object-form`, `list`, `grid`, `tags`) are configured entirely through seed `options` so site builders don't need to write React to get a usable editing UI. Widgets store clean JSON (no nesting, no mutation of shape), so removing the plugin leaves valid data in the database. See discussion #571 for background.

  Widens `FieldDescriptor.options` to `Array<{ value: string; label: string }> | Record<string, unknown>` so plugin widgets can accept arbitrary widget config (not only enum choices). The array shape for `select` / `multiSelect` continues to work unchanged.

- [#856](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/856) [`ef3f076`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ef3f076c8112e9dffc2a87c019e5521e823f5e86) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes `npm install` peer dependency conflicts (#819) by removing `react` and `react-dom` from `dependencies`. They were declared in both `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`, which made npm think the admin package required an exact pinned React version and conflicted with the host Astro app's React. They remain `peerDependencies` (`^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`), and the host app supplies React.

- [#821](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/821) [`8d0feb3`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/8d0feb3eece62b01075260bbb79188984a8631b8) Thanks [@r2sake](https://github.com/r2sake)! - Fixes the Settings (gear) icon on the Plugin Manager so it links to the plugin's primary admin page instead of a non-existent `/settings` sub-route.

- [#862](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/862) [`8354088`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/83540887936a87a6c99230b21d2afe3fe424218c) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fixes slug-style `<input pattern="...">` attributes so HTML form validation works in current browsers. The patterns used `[a-z0-9-]+`, which is rejected as `Invalid character class` when compiled with the `v` (unicode-sets) flag — the mode browsers now use for the `pattern` attribute. The dangling `-` is now escaped (`[a-z0-9\-]+`), restoring slug validation in the Sections list/edit, Menus list, and Widgets create-area dialogs. Resolves #845.

- [#887](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/887) [`254a443`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/254a443684ec3bddfc2706b349d6ccce901987af) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes stale content shown in the Portable Text editor when switching between translations of the same content. Previously, navigating from one locale's editor to another (e.g. from the English version of a post to the French version) kept the previous locale's body in the editor, and any subsequent edit would silently overwrite the new translation's content. The form now resets synchronously when the underlying content item changes, and field editors are keyed by item id so they remount cleanly on a translation switch.

- [#885](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/885) [`25128b2`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/25128b2444853e3301af7ff09d21a3f5883a599f) Thanks [@ahliweb](https://github.com/ahliweb)! - Fixes malformed ICU plural syntax in Indonesian (id) locale — ContentList item count now renders correctly

- [#872](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/872) [`ab45916`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ab45916e8561678ccddf7d6184a7d56729ea03cc) Thanks [@ahliweb](https://github.com/ahliweb)! - Enables Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia) locale in the admin UI

- [#807](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/807) [`0913a39`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/0913a39a23538c96bfa62fe7da37bf332d18bb46) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Sizes the plugin block edit modal based on field complexity so Block Kit forms have room to breathe. Simple URL embeds keep the previous compact dialog; forms with several fields get a wider one, and forms containing a repeater open at the largest size. Inputs inside the dialog now fill the available width.

- [#815](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/815) [`ddbf808`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/ddbf8088e1bcfa07d6347a953bb1995295e8f8fd) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes content list loading state showing `No results for ""` instead of a loader while items are being fetched. The trash tab gets the same treatment.

- [#870](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/870) [`1c958fb`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/1c958fb484387cd8cce7fab53ff4eddfe0dbb7f6) Thanks [@CacheMeOwside](https://github.com/CacheMeOwside)! - Fixes the image-settings icon in the Section editor so it actually opens `<ImageDetailPanel>` in the sidebar.

- [#816](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/816) [`d4be24f`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/d4be24f478a0c8d0a7bba3c299e11105bba3ed94) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Unifies plugin capability names under a single `<resource>[.<sub-resource>]:<verb>[:<qualifier>]` formula so capabilities read like RBAC permissions, separates hook-registration permissions from data-access ones for clearer audits, and replaces the overloaded `:any` qualifier with the more conspicuous `:unrestricted`. Old names are still accepted with `@deprecated` warnings; `emdash plugin bundle` and `emdash plugin validate` warn for each deprecated name and `emdash plugin publish` refuses manifests that still use them.

  The Cloudflare sandbox bridge and HTTP fetch helper now enforce canonical names (`content:read`, `content:write`, `media:read`, `media:write`, `users:read`, `network:request`, `network:request:unrestricted`). Manifests that still declare legacy names continue to work — the runner normalizes capabilities before passing them into the bridge, so installed plugins with `read:content` resolve to `content:read` and reach the same code path.

  | Old                 | New                              |
  | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | `read:content`      | `content:read`                   |
  | `write:content`     | `content:write`                  |
  | `read:media`        | `media:read`                     |
  | `write:media`       | `media:write`                    |
  | `read:users`        | `users:read`                     |
  | `network:fetch`     | `network:request`                |
  | `network:fetch:any` | `network:request:unrestricted`   |
  | `email:provide`     | `hooks.email-transport:register` |
  | `email:intercept`   | `hooks.email-events:register`    |
  | `page:inject`       | `hooks.page-fragments:register`  |

  Existing installs keep working — manifests are normalized at every external boundary and `diffCapabilities` normalizes both sides so version upgrades that only rename do not trigger a "capability changed" prompt. Deprecated names will be removed in the next minor.

- [#679](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/679) [`493e317`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/493e3172d4539d8e041e6d2bf2d7d2dc89b2a10d) Thanks [@drudge](https://github.com/drudge)! - Adds a `repeater` Block Kit element: array-of-objects with scalar sub-fields, drag-to-reorder, and collapsible item cards. Plugin block forms can now capture repeating data (FAQ rows, carousel slides, card grids) inline in the portable-text editor.

- [#779](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/779) [`e402890`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e402890fcd8647fdfe847bb34aa9f9e7094473dd) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `settings_get` and `settings_update` MCP tools so agents can read and update site-wide settings (title, tagline, logo, favicon, URL, posts-per-page, date format, timezone, social, SEO). `settings_get` resolves media references (logo/favicon/seo.defaultOgImage) to URLs; `settings_update` is a partial update that preserves omitted fields. New `settings:read` (EDITOR+) and `settings:manage` (ADMIN) API token scopes back the tools, with matching options in the personal API token settings UI.

- [#398](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/398) [`31333dc`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/31333dc593e2b9128113e4e923455209f11853fd) Thanks [@simnaut](https://github.com/simnaut)! - Adds pluggable auth provider system with AT Protocol as the first plugin-based provider. Refactors GitHub and Google OAuth from hardcoded buttons into the same `AuthProviderDescriptor` interface. All auth methods (passkey, AT Protocol, GitHub, Google) are equal options on the login page and setup wizard.

### Patch Changes

- [#611](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/611) [`86b26f6`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/86b26f6c1067efb28d8f7cb447be23da99d2e38e) Thanks [@drudge](https://github.com/drudge)! - Wires up the block configuration sidebar inside `WidgetEditor`. `PortableTextEditor` now receives `onBlockSidebarOpen`/`onBlockSidebarClose` callbacks that hold the active `BlockSidebarPanel` in local state, and renders `ImageDetailPanel` when the panel type is `"image"` — mirroring the content-entry editor. Without this, clicking a block's settings button or the media picker inside widget content had no visible effect.

- [#786](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/786) [`e998083`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e998083115b3c5a6e27707a940dfac557ea72458) Thanks [@smart-cau](https://github.com/smart-cau)! - Adds Korean translations for 21 admin UI strings that previously fell back to English.

  The server's `orderBy` field whitelist now accepts `status`, `locale`, and `name` alongside the existing date fields — unchanged from a security standpoint, the repo still rejects unknown field names to prevent column enumeration.

  Callers of `<ContentList>` that don't pass `onSortChange` render the previous static-label headers, so legacy integrations (e.g. the content picker) are unaffected.

- [#689](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/689) [`fa8d753`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/fa8d7533e8ba7e02599372d580399dae88ecd891) Thanks [@edrpls](https://github.com/edrpls)! - Fixes the taxonomy term picker to match across diacritic boundaries.

  Typing `Mexico` in the admin picker now surfaces a term labeled `México` instead of prompting a duplicate create. Input and term labels are folded via NFD decomposition + lowercase before substring-matching, so editors who type without diacritics — or with locale keyboards that produce precomposed vs. combining forms — still see the canonical term.

  Before this fix, `"mexico"` and `"méxico"` were treated as distinct strings, so the picker showed zero suggestions and the editor had no way to find the existing term except to create a duplicate. Duplicate terms then split the taxonomy and broke public-facing filter pages that group content by slug.

  The exact-match check that gates the "Create new term" button uses the same fold, so typing `Mexico` when `México` exists also suppresses Create — closing the duplicate-creation loop.
